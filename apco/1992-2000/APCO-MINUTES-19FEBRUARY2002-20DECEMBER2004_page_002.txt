Mr. Austin explained the letter to the Board of Supervisors from Ray Pethel, Interim
Transportation Commissioner regarding the reshaping of Virginia Transportation Development
Plan (VTDP) formerly known as the Six-Year Plan as instructed by the Governor. There will be
changes in priorities, possible postponing of some projects. We don’t know which projects will
be affected at this stage as a lot of things will depend upon the General Assembly.
There will be a 4% or $28,000 reduction on the Secondary plan and Mr. Austin has taken this off
the 641 project. There could be a 20-40% reduction because of various reviews. The Six Year
Plan will not be approved before April.
Due to the cash flow problems Route 652 project has been postponed because of advertisements.
Revenue Sharing applications are due for the next year and will not be affected by revenue
concerns. The deadline for Revenue Sharing Applications will be March 30, 2002.
Mr. Austin asked if anyone had any questions.
Mr. Carter commented on the mission statement.
Mr. Carwile questioned the impact on the Route 29 Bypass. It was his understanding that these
funds have been set aside for this project.
