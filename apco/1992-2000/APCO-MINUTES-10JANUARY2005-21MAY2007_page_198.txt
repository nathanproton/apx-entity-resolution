Mr. Conrad made a motion, seconded by Shawn Armbrust, to have the Board of
Supervisors support the referendum of liquor by the drink being placed on the
November ballot.
Mr. Craft stated that this matter has been talked about for some time and he feels it
should be placed before the citizens as to whether or not they want this for the County
of Appomattox. He further stated that he personally would not try to tell anyone how to
vote on this referendum but would urge them to vote their own conscience.
Mr. Armbrust stated he supported this referendum being placed on the ballot. If we do
acquire a nice restaurant chain, or another hotel, it would all be better for the taxpayers.
ROLL CALL VOTE: Mr. Armbrust, aye; Mr. Conrad, aye; Mr. Craft, aye; and Mr. Cater,
aye. (4 aye votes — 1 absent)
