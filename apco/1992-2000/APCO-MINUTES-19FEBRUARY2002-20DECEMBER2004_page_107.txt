consultants and report back to each of the governing bodies.
There was some discussion regarding the length of time it would take for an engineering firm to
review the RFP and get a reply back to the committee. Mr. Garrett feels 30 days should be
sufficient.
There will be no short term solution, acquiring the necessary withdrawal permits could take as
long as five (5) years with construction coming later. We are talking about as much as 8 years in
the making.
Short term solutions are to drill more wells and hopefully located water.
Mr. Carwile suggests tapping into different sources and develop a hub. Cost should not be the
controlling factor but it should be cost effective.
Mr. Carroll stated that if we meet our water needs we will be able to grow. We also need a vision
and plan on how we want to grow.
At 8:55 a.m. Town Council adjourned their meeting.
Mr. Carroll stated the Board of Supervisors had one item of business to discuss, the ACTIONS
committee property. To acquire the easements necessary to get this property sold will require a
lump sum of $4,000.
Mr. Kendrick made a motion seconded by Mr. Carwile to appropriate the lump sum of $4,000 to
cover the cost of this agreement. VOTE: Mr. Hancock, aye; Mr. Carwile, aye; Mr. Moore, aye;
Mr. Kendrick, aye; and Mr. Carter, aye.
At 8:57 a.m. Mr. Carwile made a motion seconded by Mr. Kendrick to adjourn the Board of
Supervisors meeting. VOTE: Mr. Hancock, aye; Mr. Carwile, aye; Mr. Moore, aye; Mr.
Kendrick, aye; and Mr. Carter, aye.
