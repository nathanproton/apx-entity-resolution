Mr. Craft stated he is still in favor of establishing a PSA so things can be managed
properly.
Mr. Carter agrees that the management is going to be very crucial. We have studies
this issue to death and from the comments received, we should move forward with the
460 waterline.
Mr. Conrad says there were a lot of good comments. However, we need to have a
Public Comments Session for the public.
It was agreed to hold a Public Comments Session on the Waterline issue at 6:00 p.m. on
Monday, June 26, 2006 at the Appomattox Community Center. The IDA will also be
invited to attend this session.
The regular meeting of the Board of Supervisors will be held on Wednesday, July 5,
2006 due to the Fourth of July Holidays.
At 8:09 P.M., Mr. Armbrust made a motion, seconded by Mr. Conrad, to adjourn. VOTE:
Mr. Armbrust, aye; Mr. Conrad, aye; Mr. Craft, aye; Mr. Moore, aye; and Mr. Carter, aye.
