The current car lot which uses Route 646 as an access has caused a lot of problems
when trying to get onto or off of Route 460 due to people stopping to look and not
getting off the road and blocking your view to enter into Route 460.
I am not happy about the new proposed car lot and garage being built at all, but if it
does happen the entrance needs to be off Route 460.
