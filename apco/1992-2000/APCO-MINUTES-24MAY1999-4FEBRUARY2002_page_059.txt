It is INCREDIBLE that we now have to pay for the next 15-20 years for something that
is PASSE” in 1 (ONE) year!
Who is to BLAME? WE ALL ARE.
AND- BEFORE WE DO THE SAME THING OVER AGAIN, “WE” NEED TO INSIST
THAT “WE” THE TAXPAYERS PARTICIPATE IN PRODUCING THE
SPECIFICATIONS FOR ANY NEW BUILDING OR RENOVATION, NOR
ALLOWING THE BUCK BE PASSED TO THE “ARCHITECT”. How does an
ARCHITECT, who lives in another community know what our needs are?
GUESSTAMATION is not the answer.

Letter to Bd. Of Supervisors
The Middle School has been operational for 1 (one) Full School Year. Has any member
of this Community: Teacher, Parent, Student, Board of Education and/or Board of
Supervisors member OR Taxpayer SEEN or RESPONDED TO any kind of a “FOLLOW
UP” Evaluation?
Follow-Up is essential “IF” we are to learn anything about how close we came to meeting
the Goal (s) or Objective(s) that we Identified for Renovation in the first place. These
Goal(s) and Objective(s) became or should have become the “Specifications” for the
Renovation, “IF” we had done a “NEEDS ASSESSMENT”.
Of course, “WE” the community did not participate in this PROCEDURE. Someone else
did it for us. We turned “our” RESPONSIBILITIED over to someone else and now
“WE” have 15 or 20 Years to PAY FOR IT!
What is IMPORTANT now, is that we do a “Follow-Up” Evaluation immediately,
BEFORE we proceed with any other CONSTRUCTION. We must learn of the Positive
things we’ve accomplished AND we must be made aware of the MISTAKES AND
ERRORS, so they are not repeated over and over again!
