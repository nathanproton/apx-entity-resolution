Mr. Carter made a motion seconded by Mr. Hancock to approve the Consent Agenda (items 6 - 20)
as presented. VOTE: Mr. Kendrick, aye; Mr. Carter, aye; Mr. Hancock, aye; Mr. Carwile, aye; and
Mr. Moore, aye.
Mr.Kendrick called for comments on the Information Items: (items 21-30)(see Board File)
Mr. Carwile initiated a discussion on the Regional Industrial Park. He expressed concern with
putting more tax burden on the taxpayers. It seems to be a good idea but he would be in favor of
waiting to see the results of the tax dollars.
Mr. Moore stated he had heard from several people who are upset with this idea and are totally
against this concept due to the fact it is so far from us. He does not feel we would ever reap any
benefits from this park.
Mr. Carter agrees with both Mr. Moore and Mr. Carwile that this concept would be beneficial to
Bedford County but not for Appomattox County. He could in no way approve joining this Regional
Park effort.
Mr. Kendrick likes the concept but since we have already started our own industrial park, he agrees
with the rest of the Board. This will be on the agenda for the February 20" meeting and at that time
we will take a vote.
At 7:40 P.M. Mr. Carter made a motion seconded by Mr. Moore to adjourn. VOTE: Mr. Kendrick,
aye; Mr. Carter, aye; Mr. Hancock, aye; Mr. Carwile, aye; and Mr. Moore, aye.
