Mr. Torrence asked if County personnel could paint the Pamplin
Volunteer Fire Department building. He explained that Pamplin was
going to have to contract this work out and he felt since the County
donated to their operation, this was not an unreasonable request.
After discussion, it was suggested that maybe Pamplin Fire Department
could hire Ricky Mayberry to do this painting, after regular working
hours.

Commission recommendations.
