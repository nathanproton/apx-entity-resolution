Both the County and Town need to take official action requesting the
National Historical Park to put the battlefield in their Master Plan.
Mr. Garrett thanked Mr. Bill Gillespie for his attendance and input into tonight’s meeting.
The suggestion was made that the Town and County consider holding these joint
meetings on a quarterly basis. Mr. Bill Phillips suggested that we continue to hold them
on Thursday evening. June 17, 2004 was selected as the next meeting date.
Mr. Carson stated that at a recent Town Council meeting they had two young people to
appear and inform them of what they had intended to do at the Longacre Bed and
Breakfast and that they had purchased the old hardware and the adjacent store
buildings and what they have in mind for these old buildings. He would like everyone to
visit Longacre and get acquainted with these young people. They really have some
good ideas and are really interested in our community.

Supervisors meeting. VOTE: Mr. Conrad, aye; Mr. Craft, aye; Mr. Moore, aye; and Mr.
