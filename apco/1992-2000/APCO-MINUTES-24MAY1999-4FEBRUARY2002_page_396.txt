Petition #00-443 - Appomattox County Industrial Development Authority - Rezone property
from A-1 to M-2. Property is the proposed Appomattox County Industrial Park located between
Routes 26 and 613.
Mr. Moore asked for comments on this petition.
Mr. Bill Slagle, Chairman of the IDA. When they explored the existing zoning of M-1 Industrial
Zone they found it did not accommodate the purposes for which this property was designed. The
IDA then developed the M-2 Zoning based on other parks in the area.
Hearing no other comments, Mr. Moore asked the Clerk to read the next petition.
Petition #00-444 - Williams Communications of Virginia, Inc. - Variance to Section 170-80
pertaining to side yard setback requirements. Property is Tax Map #75-A-2A, is zoned M-1 and is
located on Route 691 between Routes 719 and 643.
Mr. Moore asked for comments.
Ms. Linda Reeves, Field Supervisor for Williams Communications. They are requesting this petition
because they were not able to acquire the property east of where they already have concrete pads.
They had to design the building addition to avoid underground fiber optic cable leaving less than the
required 10 feet from property line.
Hearing no other comments, Mr. Moore declared the public hearing closed at 7:10 P.M.
