Mr. Paulette reconvened the meeting at 4:00 P.M. and introduced Mr.
Brian Wishneff, President of Brian Wishneff & Associates, and turned
the meeting over to Mr. Wishneff for his presentation.
Mr. Wishneff began by giving a brief profile of his economic
development background.
Mr. Wishneff then explained that presently he was working as a
consultant for different localities.
Mr. Wishneff continued, that after talking with Mr. Carwile, he feels
what Appomattox County needs is a independent view of the economic
development situation. He continued that this study may result in some
type of formal economic development program that will specifically
address Appomattox County’s needs.
Discussion followed with Mr. Wishneff answering specific questions from
Supervisors.
After discussion, and by consensus of the Board of Supervisors, Mr.
Wishneff was to develop a scope of work, and cost for services, and
return to the Board for review.
