SCHOOL BONDS OF THE COUNTY OF APPOMATTOX,
VIRGINIA TO BE SOLD TO THE VIRGINIA PUBLIC
SCHOOL AUTHORITY AND PROVIDING FOR THE FORM
AND DETAILS THEREOF
WHEREAS, in February, 1996, the Commonwealth of Virginia Board of
Education (the "Board of Education") placed the application (the
"Application") of the School Board of the County of Appomattox,
Virginia (the "School Board") for a loan or loans totalling $5,000,000
(the "Literary Fund Loan") from the Literary Fund, a permanent trust
fund established by the Constitution of Virginia and dedicated to the
support of public education in the Commonwealth of Virginia (the
"Literary Fund"), for the construction, renovation and expansion of
school buildings (the "Project") in the County of Appomattox, Virginia
(the "County"), on the First Priority Waiting List.
WHEREAS, the Board of Education was to have approved the release
of Literary Fund moneys to the School Board and made a commitment to
loan such moneys to the School Board (the "Commitment") within one (1)
year of placement of the Application on the First Priority Waiting List
upon receipt of the Literary Fund of an unencumbered sum available at
least equal to the amount of the Application and the approval, by the
Board of Education, of the Application as having met all conditions for
a loan from the Literary Fund.
WHEREAS, the Board of Education was thereafter to have given
advances on the amount of the Commitment for the Literary Fund Load to
the School Board, as construction or renovation of the Project
progressed, in exchange for temporary notes from the School Board to
the Literary Bond (the "Temporary Notes") for the amounts so advanced.
WHEREAS, after the completion of the Project and the advance of
the total amount of the Commitment, the Temporary Notes were to have
been consolidated into a permanent loan note of the School Board to the
Literary Fund (the "Literary Fund Obligation") which was to evidence
the obligation of the School Board to repay the Literary Fund Loan.
WHEREAS, the Literary Fund Obligation was to have borne interest
at two percent (2%) per annum and mature in annual installments for a
period of twenty (20) years.
WHEREAS, in connection with the 1996 Interest Rate Subsidy Program
(the "Program"), the Virginia Public School Authority (the "VPSA") has
offered to purchase general obligation school bonds of the County, and
the Board of Education has offered to pay, to the County, a lump sum
cash payment (the "Lump Sum Cash Payment"), equal to the sum of (i) net
present value difference, determined on the date that VPSA sells its
bonds, between the weighted average interest rate that the general
obligation school bonds of the County will bear upon sale to the VPSA
and the interest rate that the Literary Fund Obligation would have
borne plus (ii) an allowance for the costs of issuing such bonds of the
County (the "Issuance Expense Allowance") .
