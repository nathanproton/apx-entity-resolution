At 7:01 p.m. Mr. Pickett opened a discussion period for the School Board, Board of Supervisors
and the Appomattox Elementary School Committee.
The School Board feels that the one thing that the school would need to have is a used or built
new Maintenance Shop. This would be the only actual facility.
Mr. Carwile asked what the School Board wanted? What was their agenda?
Mr. Pickett replied a Maintenance Shop, Alternative Educational Facility. They would also like
to move the bus shop to this location.
Mrs. Martin questioned the ability to maintain the building.
Mr. Fred Lawson would like to see the building used as a community center. Raise the funds
needed. It would be a wonderful place for a facility similar to a Y, gym or day care center for the
young and the elderly.
Mr. Lawson also does not want to see the buses here. He would prefer that they be put at the new
Elementary school site.
Mr. Carter feels the committee will look at the pros/cons and move in a positive direction. They
are interested in little taxpayer burden to the Community. (Citizens Forum). Enough
expenditures already exists. They are looking for a vision - not a burden to the taxpayers.
