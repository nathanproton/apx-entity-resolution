October 11, 2004
Dear Armbrust:
My husband and I bought a house in Twin Pines Subdivision almost three years ago.
We work very hard to keep up our property. In Sept. 2004, one our neighbors, Ray
Goodman installed a 60 ft. tower plus a 12 ft. antenna and rotor near his deck on 1.83
acres of land. We soon had interference on our TV and telephone. This only occurred
when Mr. Goodman was home. Listed below are times and dates this happened.
Sept. 21, 2004 7:55 p.m. Interference with TV
Sept. 22, 2004 7:55 p.m. Was talking on the phone when voices came in on
my telephone conversation. My husband was watching TV at the
same time and had interference with the picture fading and lines.
Sept. 23, 2004 Picture blinking
Sept. 25, 2004 Interference with phone. Sounded like wires frying.
Sept. 26, 2004 Telephone interference — frying sound
Sept. 28, 2004 Telephone interference — frying sound
Mr. Goodman seems to have no concern for his neighbors. We cant go about our daily
lives without someone infringing on our rights to watch television and use our phones in
private. This tower also makes every ones property decrease in value. When we moved
in the subdivision we had no idea we would have such a eye sore and problems without
TV and telephone. We ask you to deny Mr. Goodman this permit for the tower. We
hope the county will consider the concerns of other people in Twin Pines Subdivision.
This property is located on 609 between 608 and 460.
Sincerely,
Inez Jennings
