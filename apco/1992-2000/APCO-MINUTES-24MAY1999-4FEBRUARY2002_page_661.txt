Mr. Austin asked for requests for improvement to existing roads.
No one was present seeking improvements for existing roads.
Mr. Austin moved to requests for new additions to the priority listing.
Mr. Herman Thomas of Brandonwood Lane, located off Route 669 stated he was representing
the eleven (11) homeowners on this road. They are requesting that formal action be taken to
include Brandonwood Lane in the secondary road system and that VDOT maintain this road.
They believe they are eligible for the following reasons:
: Road was built prior to July 1, 1990 and was approved by the County of
Appomattox in July 1989. This was the second part of the road. The first part has
been in existence since 1970. (Mr. Thomas had aerial photographs from 1970);
This road is available for public use seven days a week, 24 hours a day.
There is an existing 50' right of way and there are presently 11 homes located
there and room for three (3) more.
The road is presently connected to State Route 669 which is already maintained by
VDOT.
Mr Thomas passed out copies of the aerial photographs from 1970. Mr. Thomas
explained he had highlighted the road where it ran from Route 669 to Route 608
and that it had been in existence for a long time.
Mr. Thomas concluded by again requesting that this road be included in this year plans.
Mr. Austin explained the process of reviewing the road to determine eligibility and the Road
Viewers will physically review the road in the Spring of next year.
Mr. Austin asked for other questions. Hearing none he turned the meeting back over to Mr.
Kendrick.
Mr. Kendrick closed the VDOT 6 Year Plan Public Hearing at 6:20 P.M.
