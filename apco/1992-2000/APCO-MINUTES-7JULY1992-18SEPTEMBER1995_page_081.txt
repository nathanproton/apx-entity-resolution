Mr. Jamerson replied he had not compared his’ figures to
Draper Aden’s nor had he analyzed Draper Aden’s study. He
did point out, however, that Draper Aden’s’' study did not
consider the $17.21 per ton the County collects from users
fees. Mr. Torrence also pointed out Draper Aden’s study
considered $50,000.00 per acre cost to close the existing
landfill and Hurt and Proffitt estimates this cost to be
$35,000.00 per acre.
Mr. Torrence asked if Mr. Carwile thought there would be
enough time to implement the plan to use the private landfill
in Amelia before the County would have to act, i.e. before
October 1993. Mr. Carwile replied there were other Counties
with no plans to modernize and continue operations that would
be forced to use a private landfill after January, 1994 and,
he reasoned, if they could implement this option in that time
span, he felt Appomattox could also.
Mr. Moore asked Mr. Carwile if there were any errors in the
figures or reasoning presented by Mr. Jamerson. Mr. Carwile
responded the "mandates and new guidelines" were not included
in the figures. Mr. Jamerson explained the figures included
closing the old and existing portion of the landfill under
existing regulations, opening a new cell in accord with new
regulations, and closing that cell under the newer
regulations. Mr. Rice explained there was $400,000.00
budgeted for in the Bond money to close the old and existing
landfill and $1,000,000.00 to open a new five (5) acre cell.
This would deplete the Bond money. Additionally, current
plans are to set aside $150,000.00 each year starting FY93
(July 1, 1992) to close the new cell. Therefore, if the new
cell lasts three (3) years starting in October of 1993, there
would be $600,000.00 accumulated by October 1996 to close the
new cell. If the new cell lasted five (5) years or until
October 1998, there would be $900,000.00 to close the new
cell. Based on current dollars, some engineers are
estimating costs for closing landfills under the new
regulations will be about $200,000.00 per acre.
Therefore, the $150,000.00 per year set aside may not be
enough to close depending on the actual life of the new five
(5) acre cell. Mr. Jamerson acknowledged this will have to
be considered as closure costs are more accurately projected
and as the actual life of the new cell becomes better
defined. More than $150,000.00 per year might have to be set
aside. Also, interest accumulated on the money set aside and
inflation will have to be accounted for. Further, Mr.
Jamerson reasoned, the County might have to reevaluate the
users fees, but in any event, he felt until now no actual
figures were available to base any of these decisions on.
Mr. Carwile wondered if increased user fees might place too
large a burden on industries. Mr. Peterson noted most other
landfills were charging more than Appomattox and business and
industries probably could not dispose of their waste anyplace
else at a lessor expense. Mr. Jamerson added he felt the
County is obligated to service Appomattox County’s business
and industries and he would not favor fees so high it would
force existing business out nor prevent new ones from moving
