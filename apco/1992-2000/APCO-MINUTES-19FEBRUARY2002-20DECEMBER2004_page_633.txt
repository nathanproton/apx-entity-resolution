Ms. Ferguson explained that we would be dealing with the Campbell County PSA. The
source itself may not be any different, only the avenue to get it here and the cost This
is just another option that is out there that she feels needs to be looked into.
There was some discussion regarding whether or not the monies that we have already
spent would cover this. The study we are paying for should consider every source that is
out there.
The Board by consensus, agreed to pursue this option.
