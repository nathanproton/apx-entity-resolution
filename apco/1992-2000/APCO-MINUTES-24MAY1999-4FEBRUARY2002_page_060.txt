We must begin to have everyone PARTICIPATE in the PLANNING of any new
CONSTRUCTION. IF WE MUST PAY, WE MUST HAVE “SAY”. We cannot afford
anymore mistakes, there are many in the community whose very homes are in Peril due
to the inability to bear rising cost in every area but particularly in TAXES.
WE SHOULD MOVE QUICKLY TO “AIR-CONDITION” THE ELEMENTARY
SCHOOL. THAT SHOULD BE OUR ONLY “MAJOR” EXPENDITURE AT THAT
SCHOOL UNTIL “WE” DO THE GROUND WORK REQUIRED TO REALLY PALN
FOR OUR NEEDS.
-And after these debates, we will all continue to be servants of God, friends, neighbors
and the best example of what it means to be an American...to have the right, privilege and
sometimes duty to “SPEAK OUT” and express our opinion. God Bless America. For
ONLY in America is it possible for every citizen to do so.
Very truly yours,
Dr. Betty W. Siano

Mr. Bosiger then explained that Fred Jones has requested that Mr. Carter read a letter
from him to the Board.
To: Appomattox County Board of Supervisors
From: Fred Jones
I would like say a few things that are of concern to me about the subject of new vs.
renovation. First you projected a land cost for the renovation of $192,000, and when
asked where that figure came from, you said “part of it was Fred Jones”. I, nor my
employees or any representative has been contacted by a member of the board to see if I
was still interested in selling and what part they were interested in. Since it was brought
up at the last meeting that you do not need 20 acres, why do you need more land?
Second, the 30” width of 691 has been a problem for years and we have asked VDOT to
widen it, but they would not then and will not now. Third, you had a cost in your
renovation figures of $14,000 for extra mileage on the buses to go around the back of the
elementary school to get to Rt. 24. But there was no mention of extra bus mileage cost
for the new site which is out of the way of the current bus routes by just about a mile.
Forth, if you could not afford to pay for Al Jones to keep his position, how can you afford
to build a new school and fix up the existing one?
Thank you for your time and consideration of these matters.
Fred Jones
Mr. Bosiger then stated that we had also received letters from the following people
concerning the elementary school project.
