May xx, 2005 - Old-new address cross reference sent to Richmond and WV
USPS.
Sept. 7, 2005 — Notified by WV USPS that they should be complete with
entering Appomattox addresses by the end of October.
Sept. 9, 2005 — Notified by Richmond USPS that they have completed entering
the Pamplin addresses into the system.
Oct. 31, 2005 — Sent telephone/new address cross-reference to Verizon. They
informed Timmons Group that they cannot begin entering new addresses until
they receive a formal letter from the USPS that new addresses have been
accepted.
Oct. 31, 2005- Spoke with WV USPS and they said they hope to have the
24522 zip code complete during November. The other zip codes would not be
started until January 2006. They were unsure about being able to send a letter
to Verizon since they had never done that before. They would talk to their
supervisor about this. The plan is to get a letter fro the 24522 zip code once it is
complete, so Verizon can start entering that data.
Nov. 1, 2005- Richmond USPS does not know if Pamplin has started using the
addresses. Said we should contact Pamplin to find out. Have called several
times and do not get an answer.
Nov. 1, 2005- Contacted Wireless Services Board to put pressure on WV USPS.
There will be no data entry during the month of December because of the Christmas
rush. Not having all the data entered will push the project back until sometime in early
2006. The US Postal Service will inform residents by mail as to when the new system
will be implemented.
