Mr. Bosiger called the work session to order and welcomed the members of Town
Council. Mr. Bosiger explained the reason for the work session was to review options
related to the sewer expansion proposed by the Town. Mr. Bosiger then asked Mayor
Spiggle if he would bring the Board of Supervisors up to date on the proposed sewer
expansion.
Mayor Spiggle stated that the Town was in the process of working with Rural
Development to get funding for this project. He continued that they were also looking at
other alternatives to be sure that the most feasible alternative was chosen to solve the
sewer problems. Mayor Spiggle stated that the Town was seeking grant funding to assist
with the cost of this project and if a grant was obtained it would be for at least
$125,000.00. Mayor Spiggle explained that they should know sometime in October how
much grant funding would be available. Mayor Spiggle stated that any grant funding that
was received would come off the total cost and then the County would pay according to
this adjusted figure.
