4. Resolution from Meckenburg County: Mecklenburg County as requested that
the Board consider adopting a similar resolution to the one they adopted in favor
of the Tobacco Buy-Out program. Staff has little knowledge about the proposed
buy-out program and at this time cannot make a recommendation to the Board on
the issue. Staff will pursue additional information on the matter if the Board
desires.
