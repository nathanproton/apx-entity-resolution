to be shared with state and local governments.
Discussion followed.
After discussion, Mr. Carter made a motion seconded by Mr. Carwile to adopt the
following resolution:
WHEREAS, the development of federal oil and gas resources on the Outer Continental
Shelf liquidates a capital asset of the nation; and
WHEREAS, a significant portion of the liquidated capital assets of the nation should be
reinvested in the conservation and enhancement of other precious capital assets of our
nation, including the coastal zone, inland habitat and wildlife resources; and
WHEREAS, coastal states that host federal offshore oil and gas development are
suffering adverse impacts on their environment and increased pressure on their public
services for which mitigation and compensation should be made by the federal
government; and
WHEREAS, under the Mineral Lands Leasing Act, when federal mineral resources are
developed on shore, the federal government shares 50% of its revenues from that
development with the host state;
