6. 460 Waterline/Public Service Authority: At the Joint meeting of the
Appomattox Town Council and the Appomattox County Board of
Supervisors it was discussed as to the best way to proceed with the
waterline project and the establishment of a Public Service Authority. It
was determined by both governing bodies that there was a need for one
person to take this project on full time in order to progress at a
reasonable pace. The consensus of both bodies was that the Region 2000
Regional Commission would be the best group to proceed with these
efforts on behalf of the Town and County. Staff is requesting that the
Board take official action to engage Region 2000 Regional Commission to
proceed with the 460 Waterline project and the development of a PSA.
The approximate cost would be $50,000.00 divided equally between the
two localities.
