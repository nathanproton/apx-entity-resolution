4Q4
Mr. Carroll explained that he and Mrs. Carter had been reviewing the groundwater
monitoring reports and felt that a more detailed analysis of these reports and some other
corrective actions could probably be taken to get the landfill back into detection
monitoring. Mr. Carroll asked for permission to check with firms other than the ones we
were presently using to see if another company could provide more expertise in the area
of groundwater monitoring.
After discussion, and by consensus, the Board of Supervisors agreed for Mr. Carroll to
proceed with checking with other firms on the groundwater-monitoring program at the
landfill.
Mr. Bosiger asked for other business.
Mr. Torrence then stated that he had some names to submit for the Sports Complex
Committee. Mr. Torrence provided the names for Mrs. Ferguson and asked that a
committee be appointed at the next Board of Supervisors meeting.
Mr. Bosiger stated that the public hearing on the budget had been scheduled for May 4,
1998 and that he felt that the date should be changed to May 18, 1998. Mr. Bosiger
continued that the reason for the date change was to allow for time to meet with
department heads and constitutional officers concerning their budgets.
After discussion and by consensus of the Board it was agreed to hold the budget public
hearing on May 18, 1998 at 6:30 P.M.
Mr. Bosiger called for other business.
Hearing none, Mr. Moore made a motion seconded by Mr. Torrence to adjourn at 9:24
P.M. Vote: Mr. Bosiger, aye; Mr. Carter, aye; Mr. Moore, aye; Mr. Torrence, aye.
