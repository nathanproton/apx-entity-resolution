The County recognizes that the exclusion from gross income of interest on the
Bonds is based in part on the representations contained in the Use of Proceeds Certificate
and contingent on the continuing compliance by the County with the covenants contained
in the Use of Proceeds Certificate.
Accordingly, the County certifies that it has reviewed the representations set forth
in the Use of Proceeds Certificate with respect to the School Projects (the “UPC
Representations”) and the use of the School Projects and that it has discussed wit the
School Board of the County (the “School Board”) their use of the School Projects. Based
on such review and discussions, the County hereby certifies that the UPC Representations
continue to be true and correct. Such provisions are hereby incorporated by reference
into this certificate and shall be treated as representations made by the County as if set
forth herein. Furthermore, the County has discussed the UPC Representations with the
School Board and neither the County nor the School Board will take nay action that is
inconsistent with such UPC Representations.
The County further covenants that:
(a) it shall use the Distribution to pay for the cost of public school capital
purposes within six months of the date hereof and that such public school capital
purposes shall be used in a manner consistent with the UPC Representations (references
to school projects shall hereinafter include the public school capital purposes acquired
with the Distribution);
(b) it shall not sell or otherwise dispose of the School Projects prior to the
final maturity date of the Bonds of August 1, 2013 except as shall be permitted in the
opinion of an attorney or firm of attorneys, acceptable to the Issuer, nationally recognized
as experienced with respect to matters pertaining to the exclusion from gross income for
federal income tax purposes of interest on obligations of States and political subdivisions:
(c) it shall not knowingly take any action which will, or fail to take any action
which failure will, cause the interest on the Bonds to become includable in the gross
income of the owners of the Bonds for federal income tax purposes pursuant to the
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations
promulgated thereunder in effect on the date of original issuance of the Bonds; and
(d) in furtherance of its obligations under its County Bonds, it shall obtain the
same covenants contained in subparagraph (a), (b) and (c) above from the School Board
with respect to the School Projects.
