There are some repairs that need to be done to the precinct buildings that are
owned by the County. This figure is presently undetermined and will be added
to “5413 — Miscellaneous” , when estimates are completed.
Mr. Underwood explained that the Stonewall building needs a new roof, some
painting on the inside and a sealer on the floor to keep down dust. At Agee, the
inside needs to be painted and some work on the ceiling from water stain. Vera
needs to be painted on the inside as well. They also have a broken window that
needs to be replaced. The Chap building needs some work on both the inside
and outside. They have received two (2) estimates and they are looking at
about $8,000.00 to make these repairs.
The Electoral Board would also like to have someone check on these precinct
buildings periodically to make sure they are not in need of repairs. They have
not had any problems with vandalism in the past.
Ms. Ferguson reminded them that the County only has one maintenance person
who is responsible for all the buildings the County owns. It is impossible for him
to do everything that should be done. He tries to check these buildings out prior
to an election being held.
The Electoral Board also reported that they have spoken with Roberta Savio, who
works at the landfill, and she had given them an estimate for cleaning these
buildings before each election. This estimate was approximately $200.00.
The Registrar’s budget was discussed briefly. There appeared to be no problems
with this.
Mr. Carter thanked the Electoral Board for appearing.
At 8:00 p.m. Mr. Armbrust made a motion, seconded by Mr. Conrad, to adjourn.
VOTE: Mr. Armbrust, aye; Mr. Conrad, aye; and Mr. Carter, aye. (3 aye votes, 2
absent).
