Mr. Carwile had a question regarding the minutes. Mr. Carroll asked him to clarify his
question.
Mr. Carwile stated that at one of the meetings in August the Board took into
consideration the structure of the tourism program and the Administrator was supposedly
to be directed by the Chairman as to what the Board’s decision was to report to Ann
Dixon as to how she would be structured in this program.
Mr. Carroll s tated t hat it was his understanding o f what the Board wished todo. He
informed Mr. Carter that this action would have to be taken in open session in order for it
to take effect. The discussion in open session was that the Board intended to have the
Tourism Director report directly to the Board. It was a question as to whether this would
take place through a Parks Authority which he was instructed to get more information on
or whether it would be by an exception to the Personnel Policy.
Mr. Carwile asked Mr. Carroll if he had spoken with Ms. Dixon regarding what the
Board had discussed in this regard. M r. Carwile also read a copyof amemoto Ms.
Dixon from Mr. Carroll.
