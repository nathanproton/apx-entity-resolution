Mr. Bosiger called the meeting to order at 7:00 P.M. and called on Mr. Torrence to give
the invocation.
Mr. Bosiger then called for approval of the minutes.
Mr. Carwile made a motion seconded by Mr. Torrence to approve the minutes of the
regular meeting of May 4, 1998; and a recessed meeting of May 11, 1998. Vote: Mr.
Bosiger, aye; Mr. Carter, aye; Mr. Carwile, aye; Mr. Moore, aye; Mr. Torrence, aye.
Mr. Bosiger then explained the next item of business was approval of the FY99 budget.
Mr. Bosiger continued that there were several issues still unresolved. Mr. Bosiger
explained there were $128,186.00 in unassigned funds for FY99 and two requests for
these funds totaling $150,378.00. Mr. Bosiger explained in detail the two requests for
funding to be reinstated in the FY99 budget. Mr. Bosiger then called for discussion on
this matter.
Mr. Carwile began by stating that he realized that the feelings of the Board of Supervisors
were to make necessary funds available to the Schools as well as the Sheriff. Mr.
Carwile continued that since there were not enough funds available to fund both request
he felt the Sheriffs request of $25,317.00 should be met and appropriate $85,000.00 to
the school budget. Mr. Carwile stated that from his research he felt the $85,000.00 would
cover the schools needs.
Mr. Torrence stated he felt the schools request for $125,061.00 to be reinstated in their
budget was the minimum needed to fully operate. Mr. Torrence stated he felt funds were
available to fully fund both requests even if it meant reducing the CIP fund in order to
accomplish this.
A lengthy discussion followed.
