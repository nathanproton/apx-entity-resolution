21. Regional 2000 Economic Development Partnership: Region 2000
Economic Development Partnership has provided information on their
work program for the coming fiscal year.
22. Town of Appomattox: Agenda for Appomattox Town Council meeting
for July 12, 2004.
Mr. Carter next called for Supervisor Concerns:
Mr. Conrad stated he would like to discuss the Planning Commission
membership. The Appomattox County Code - Chapter 30, §30-1,
paragraph D states: “Governing body members serving as planning
commissioners. One (1) governing body member from the County and
each of the Towns may serve as a planning commissioner.....”. This
means one (1) only. Presently there are two (2) council members from
the Towns of Appomattox and Pamplin serving on the Planning
Commission. He is requesting that these localities be notified that they
need to replace one member on the Planning Commission with a non-
council member.
Mr. Armbrust informed the Board that the speed limit changes from 45
mph to 55 mph on US 460 west in the vicinity of Appomattox Ford.
There is also a day care center in this area. With the addition of the
Appomattox True Value Hardware recently opening he would like to have
VDOT continue the 45 mph section up to the entrance to the Moose
Lodge. This would mean moving the 55 mph signs approximately 75 feet
further up US 460 west.
Ms. Ferguson will issue a written request to the Virginia Department of
Transportation for this change.
Mr. Carter informed the Board that Mrs. Ferguson would like to hold a work
session on Monday. July 26, 2004. This date was not convenient for all
members. It was decided to hold this work session on Wednesday, July 28,
2004 at 6:00 p.m. at the Appomattox Town Office.
Mr. Carter reminded the Board of the next regular meeting:
Monday, August 2, 2004
6:00 p.m.
Appomattox Town Office.
At 8:45 p.m. Mr. Conrad made a motion, seconded by Mr. Craft, to adjourn.
VOTE: Mr. Armbrust, aye; Mr. Conrad, aye; Mr. Craft, aye; Mr. Moore, aye; and
