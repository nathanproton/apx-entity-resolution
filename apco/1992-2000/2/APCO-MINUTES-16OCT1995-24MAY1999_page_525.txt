Mr. Torrence asked Mr. Carwile if he had an interest in the situation that brought this
matter up?
Mr. Carwile stated that this issue was looking to the future, not the present and the future
could involve any member of the Board.
Mr. Bosiger stated that the way he saw this Mr. Lawson’s advice to Mr. Carwile was that
he could either vote or not vote, that it was Mr. Carwile’s decision, but if he chose not to
vote he had to tell the Board why.
Mr. Carwile stated that he did not know for what reason he couldn’t vote, so he did not
have a reason.
(Mr. Carwile called the County Administrator’s Office on November 3, 1998 at 10:30
AM. and asked Mrs. Phelps to tell Mrs. Ferguson that he abstained from voting on the
direction of the Commonwealth Attorney.)
Mr. Torrence asked if there were any rules that could be addressed that would deal with
the age of trailers or abandoned trailers?
Mr. Bosiger stated that he believed that this would be a separate issue.
Mrs. Ferguson stated that maybe the Board should consider a maintenance ordinance to
help regulate this type problem.
Mrs. Ferguson was asked to look into this matter and report back to the Board.
Mr. Bosiger next asked the Board of Supervisors to approve a new panel of physicians
for Workers Compensation.
Mr. Torrence made a motion seconded by Mr. Carwile to adopt the following panel of
physicians for Workers Compensation:
