After some discussion, Mr. Kendrick made a motion seconded by Mr. Moore to approve the
Consent Agenda as presented. VOTE: Mr. Hancock, aye; Mr. Carwile, aye; Mr. Moore, aye; Mr.
Kendrick, aye; and Mr. Carter, aye.
Mr. Carter next called attention to the INFORMATIONAL ITEMS:
12. School Board’s Monthly Financial Report: Report for April 2002.
13. Town of Appomattox Agenda: Agenda for Town’s meeting held on February 26, 2002.
14. _ Virginia’s Retreat: A “Regional Tourism Marketing Consortium” sponsored by Virginia’s
Retreat will be held on Monday, March 18, 2002 from 11:00 A.M. to 3:00 P.M. at
Southside Virginia Community College in Keysville. Congressman Virgil Goode will be
the keynote speaker. The Board is invited to attend.
There being no questions regarding the Informational Items, Mr. Carter called for Supervisor’s
Concerns.
Mr. Kendrick is still concerned with littering. The Board should at some time adopt an
ordinance concerning this issue. The County is far too pretty to have the amount of littering it
has. He feels that the landfill trucks actually picking up the trash causes a lot of the problems.
Mr. Carter has also received complaints regarding trash falling off the landfill trucks.
Mr. Moore does not have any problems with the landfill trucks but people in general throwing
trash from automobiles.
Mr. Carwile stated he had previously requested, for budget purposes, information on County and
school system employees. In addition to that information, he would like to know the number of
those employed in these two systems, who actually live outside the County?
Hearing no other concerns, Mr. Carter called for a motion to adjourn.
At 8:10 P.M. on a motion by Mr. Kendrick, seconded by Mr. Hancock, the meeting was
adjourned.
