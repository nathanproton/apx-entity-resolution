Ms. Terri Conrad, Appomattox, a member of the Tourism Task Force came
forward. The Tourism Task Force held a meeting this afternoon. She thought
Mr. Bill Burke was going to be present tonight. She is making a plea to the Board
of Supervisors to consider granting the Chamber funding for tourism or at least a
portion of the funding immediately so that the momentum that has been started
with several projects in the County will not stall, be stopped and possibly lost.
Ms. Conrad closed by thanking the Board for considering this request.
