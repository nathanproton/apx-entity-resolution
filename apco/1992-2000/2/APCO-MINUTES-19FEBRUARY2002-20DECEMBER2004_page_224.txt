At 7:50 p.m. Mr. Carter reopened the meeting and presented the Administrative Items:
1. Proposed Zoning Amendment — Mobile Homes as Accessory Buildings: The
Planning Commission is recommending that the Zoning Ordinance regarding the
use of mobile homes as accessory buildings be amended. A public hearing to
obtain comments from the public will be necessary.
Mr. Carwile questioned the use of mobile homes for purposes other than living quarters.
As he sees it, this would only be permissible in A-1 Agriculture Zoning. He cannot
support it.
Mr. Stidham explained that these units could be used on R-2 residential as well as A-1
Agriculture.
Mr. Carter stated he had a concern regarding the repealing of the exception for the
infirmed and elderly family members.
Mr. Stidham explained the issues regarding the elderly and infirmed.
There were some questions concerning the enforcement of this section of the ordinance.
It was the consensus of the Board to send this proposed amendment to the Zoning
Ordinance back to the Planning Commission with instructions to revisit both of these
issues, especially regarding the R-1 and H-1 designations.
