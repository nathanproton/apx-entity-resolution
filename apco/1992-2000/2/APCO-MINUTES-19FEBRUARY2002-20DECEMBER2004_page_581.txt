than going to the Treasurer’s Office and paying your money. When everyone
had a farm this was fine, but now that there are so many residential
neighborhoods this is not good.
Mr. Carter asked if anyone else present wished to address the Board.
Mr. Carter next called attention to the ADMINISTRATIVE ITEMS: (Items 1-6)
1. Appomattox Youth Sports, Inc. The Appomattox Youth Sports is
requesting the use of the fields at the old elementary school for little
league football and cheerleading practice. They will provide a certificate
of insurance.
Mr. Carter stated this was something that had been ongoing for the past several
years and since the school property will be turned back over to the County in
June, this letter is being addressed to the Board.
Mr. Conrad made a motion, seconded by Mr. Moore, to approve Appomattox
Youth Sports, Inc. the use of the grounds at the old elementary school for little
league football and cheerleading practices. VOTE: Mr. Armbrust, aye; Mr.
Conrad, aye; Mr. Craft, aye; Mr. Moore, aye; and Mr. Carter, aye. (5 aye votes)
2. FY2005 Budget and Appropriations Resolution: The FY2005 Budget
is ready for the Board to adopt and the Appropriations Resolution
approved.
Mr. Carter called the Board’s attention to a couple of changes on the
Appropriations Resolution:
1101 — Board of Supervisors change $254,131.00 to $274,131.00
3203 — Volunteer Rescue Squads change $40,700.00 to $20,700.00
This does not change the total as some money was put in 3203 that should have
been put in 1101.
Mr. Conrad stated that since the Board has been working on the Budget for
some time now, he made a motion that the Board adopt the FY2005 budget as
presented and approve the Appropriations Resolution. Mr. Craft seconded the
motion. VOTE: Mr. Armbrust, aye; Mr. Conrad, aye; Mr. Craft, aye; Mr. Moore,
aye; and Mr. Carter, aye. (5 aye votes)
Mr. Carter again commended Ms. Ferguson for putting together the Budget
without any tax increases.
3. Carry Over Fund to FY2005: The Library has requested that $1,476.44
be rolled over from the FY2004 budget to the FY2005 budget. These
funds consist of donations made to the Summer Reading Program.
