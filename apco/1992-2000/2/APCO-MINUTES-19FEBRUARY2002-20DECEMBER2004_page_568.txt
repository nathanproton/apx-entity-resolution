5. War Memorial: This item is in regards to the dedicating of a site in
Courthouse Square for the war memorial, proposed by Mr. Wayne Phelps.
Mr. Conrad stated that this was discussed at the last meeting. Mr. Conrad
suggested that Mr. Phelps be given a period of approximately 3 years to raise
funds for this project before a specific site will be designated.
Mr. Moore feels that in order for these funds to be raised, Mr. Phelps needs to
know that the site will be available.

is needed to express the intent of the Board that this memorial be placed in the
Courthouse Square.
