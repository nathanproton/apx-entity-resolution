Mr. Bosiger called the meeting to order and asked Sheriff Wilson Staples to appear
before the Board.
Sheriff began by explaining his reason for requesting an audience with the Board was to
explain he could not operate with the amount of reduction in his FY99 budget proposed
by the Board of Supervisors. Sheriff Staples then presented a handout explaining his
budget request.
A lengthy discussion followed.
After discussion, Sheriff Staples was requested to see if he could have the cost of one
vehicle left in his FY98 budget and the Board of Supervisors would try to fund four
vehicles from unappropriated surplus.
Mr. Bosiger thanked and excused Sheriff Staples.
