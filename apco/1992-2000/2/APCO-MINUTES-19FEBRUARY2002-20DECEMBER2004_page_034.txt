Mr. Carter read the following statement as to the proper procedure for conducting the Public
Hearing:
This joint public hearing provides property owners with the opportunity to present their
zoning petitions, and concerned citizens with the chance to speak in support of or against
the petitions, before the Appomattox County Planning Commission and Board of
Supervisors.
Please note that the public hearing is not the appropriate forum to engage in discussion of
the petitions. Discussion will take place during the Planning Commission meeting that
will immediate follow the public hearing.
We will begin a hearing of each petition with comments by the petitioner, followed by
comments from individuals to speak for the petition, and finally by individuals speaking
against the petition. As you approach the microphone, please state your name and
address for the record.
Mr. Carter then turned the meeting over to Brandon Stidham, County Planner.
Mr. Stidham stated that Petition 02-493 as advertised was withdrawn by the applicant prior to
public hearing. Mr. Stidham continued with the following:
