At 7:00 p.m. Mr. Carter re-opened the meeting for a Joint Public
Hearing with the Planning Commission. Mr. Carter read the
following statement:
This joint public hearing provides property owners with the opportunity to
present their zoning petitions, and concerned citizens with the chance to
speak in support of or against the petitions, before the Appomattox County
Planning Commission and Board of Supervisors.
Please note that the public hearing is not the appropriate forum to engage
in discussion of the petitions. Discussion will take place during the
Planning Commission meeting that will immediate follow the public
hearing.
We will begin a hearing of each petition with comments by the petitioner,
followed by comments from individuals to speak for the petition, and
finally by individuals speaking against the petition. As you approach the
microphone, please state your name and address for the record.
