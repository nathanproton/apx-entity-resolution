acquisition, design, construction and equipping of the Courthouse Project and (b) to issue, offer
and sell its lease revenue note or bond in an approximate amount of $2,574,000 to refund the

lease the underlying projects financed from the Outstanding 1998 Bonds (the “1998 Projects”) to
the County to accomplish certain purposes of the Virginia Industrial Development and Revenue
Bond Act (the “Act”), providing its moral obligation in support of the payment of the Series A
Note and the Series B Note and the Authority has agreed to do so; and
