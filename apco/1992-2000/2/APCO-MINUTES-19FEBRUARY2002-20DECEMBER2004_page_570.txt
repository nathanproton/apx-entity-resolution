Mr. Craft had a question pertaining to a bill for the landfill and also the Historical

Mr. Conrad made a motion, seconded by Mr. Moore to approve the Consent
Agenda as presented. VOTE: Mr. Conrad, aye; Mr. Craft, aye; Mr. Moore, aye;
and Mr. Carter, aye. (4 aye votes and 1 absent)
Mr. Carter stated the need to enter into closed session in regard to §2.2-3711-
A.6 - Investment of Public Funds (competitive solutions) and §2.2-3711-A.7 -
Consultation with Legal Counsel.
Mr. Overstreet stated he would like to make a statement for the public as well as
the news media as to why a closed session is necessary. This is in regard to the
procurement of the telephone system for the Courthouse Complex. This was
placed on competitive bids where we received proposals. In looking at these
proposals, we determine which proposal is best suited to our needs, not
necessarily the lowest bid. Negotiations can then be made with the suppliers.
Due to time restraints, administration will need some guidelines as to the
negotiations and who to negotiate with and on what basis and price. If this
discussion were held in open session it will not help us very much with
negotiating. Therefore, he is asking that this discussion be held in closed session
under §2.2-3711 A.6 — Investment of Public Funds — (competition or bargaining
is involved and public disclosure would jeopardize the County’s or Town's
bargaining or negotiating position) and §2.2-3711-A.7 Consultation with Legal
Counsel deals with the discussion of Freedom Ridge Retirement Community
request for re-zoning.
Mr. Hamlett with the Times-Virginian voiced his objection to the closed session
on the zoning matter.
