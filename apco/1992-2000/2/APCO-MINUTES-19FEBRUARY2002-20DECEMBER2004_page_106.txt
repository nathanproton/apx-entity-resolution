At 8:08 a.m. Mr. Spiggle opened the joint meeting for both the Town Council and the County
Board of Supervisors and gave the invocation.
Mr. Spiggle stated the purpose of the meeting was to discuss the Water Study. Mr Spiggle feels
that water is great concern to everyone in the community. He does not feel that wells are the best
way to secure water as eventually this underground source of water will not be there. The Town
is presently looking at fives well sites close to town.
The Town Council has asked residents to voluntarily conserve water.
Mr. Carroll and Mr. Garrett have worked on a RFP to secure engineering services to explore the
possibilities for some alternative sites (approximately six sites) for future water supply. Mr.
Spiggle also discussed the current water situation and stated his concern about the future of water
in the area.
Mr. Carter stated he was glad to see the two groups were working together in a joint effort as
something has got to be done if we are to continue with the quality of life we are having.
Mr. Carwile feels this is an essential need for both the County and the Town. He would like to
look at this the source of water, who has rights to it and how much it can be drawn down. Also
what source of water is more likely to be found that will provide water for a long time and not
focus on the monetary cost.
Mr. Garrett thinks it will take about six months to do the study on the seven areas involved. We
need both short-term and long-term solutions.
There was some discussion as to the best ways to proceed.
Mr. Garrett went over the RFP with the combined governing bodies.
A committee consisting of one member from the Town Council and one member from the
County Board of Supervisors to join with David Garrett and Andy Carroll to work with the
