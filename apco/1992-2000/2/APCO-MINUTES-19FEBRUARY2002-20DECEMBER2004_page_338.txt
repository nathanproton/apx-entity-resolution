Mr. Carter stated this Public Hearing provides property owners the opportunity to present
zoning petitions and concerned citizens the chance to speak for or against the petitions
before the Appomattox County Planning Commission and Board of Supervisors. Please
note that the public hearing is not the appropriate forum to engage in discussion of the
petitions.
Discussion will take place during the Planning Commission meeting immediately
following the Public Hearing. We will begin a hearing of each petition with comments
by the petitioner, followed by comments from individuals to speak for and /or against the
petition. As you approach the microphone, please state your name and address for the
record.
Mr. Carter turned the meeting over to Mr. Stidham who read the first petition.
#03-525 — 460 Mini-storage LLC: Amend conditional use permit per §170-47 of the
Appomattox County Zoning Ordinance to allow an on-site manager’s apartment at an
existing self-storage business. Property is located on US 460 East between Rt. 648 and
Rt. 667, Tax Nap #73(A)20C and is zoned B-1 Business.
Mr. Stidham asked if anyone wished to speak for this petition.
Mr. Bill Jamerson, owner of the 460 Mini-Storage came forward Mr. Jamerson is
requesting that if the opportunity presents itself, they might consider an on-site manager
and would like take the opportunity to lay out the plumbing, etc., while they are building
these units.
Mr. Stidham called for any additional comments for or against this petition.
