5. E-911 Structure Number Signage: The Public Safety Committee has
submitted its recommendation that the County assume the cost to
manufacture and initially install structure number signage as part of the
E911 implementation project. The County’s E-911 tax may be used for
the cost of these signs. If adopted the structure number criteria would
apply only to the County, the Towns of Appomattox and Pamplin would
be responsible for establishing their own criteria.
