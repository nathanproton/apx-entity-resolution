18. Appomattox Town Council Agenda : Agenda for workshop on April
27, 2004.
19: Supervisor Concerns:
Mr. Armbrust and Mr. Craft had some comments regarding the proposed
460 Waterline Project. Has a definite decision be made?
Mr. Moore had received some concerns that it was just to help the Town.
Mr. Armbrust questioned the County’s contribution to the Re-enactment
Fund. If the County is contributing to this event, why are they also
seeking donations from other sources. Do they have a budget?
Mrs. Ferguson will check on this and get this information to the members.
