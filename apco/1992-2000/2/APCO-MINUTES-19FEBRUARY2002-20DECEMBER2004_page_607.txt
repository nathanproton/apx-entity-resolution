8B. Tax Exempt Status: Mr. Overstreet presented each one with a handout
and stated that the Board may wish to look at this and take action at the
second meeting in August. He stated there are two (2) types of
exemptions for localities in the State of Virginia. The two ways to exempt
organizations is through classification and through designation.
Classification means churches - any type of organization that fits into the
category of a church. Designation means a specific organization. Such as
AWAG, the Historical Society, etc.
Since 2003 the Legislature has now authorized you to designate local
organizations as exempt from taxation. Mr. Overstreet then explained the
process through which you make this determination for certain non-profit
organizations. We have received a request for a tax-exempt status from a
local organization. In looking through this material, you need to think
about what you would like to have as a policy — we need to try to treat all
organizations the same.
