Mr. Caldwell read petition number 98-344 of Eileen McCormick for a variance to
paragraph 170-81 of the Appomattox County Zoning Ordinance pertaining to location of
Accessory building on lot. Property is located on Route 620 between Route 601 and
Route 619. Property is zoned A-1.
Mr. Bosiger called on comments on this petition.
Mrs. McCormick came forward and stated she was requesting this variance because she
did not wish to own more property but was in need of a storage building. Mrs.
McCormick continued that the building would be vinyl sided in order to match the house
and be an asset to the property.
Mr. Bosiger called for comments on this petition.
Hearing none, and their being no further petitions, Mr. Bosiger declared the public
hearing closed at 7:05 P.M.
