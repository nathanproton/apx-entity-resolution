Mr. Carter read the following statement:
This joint public hearing provides property owners the opportunity to present their zoning
petitions and concerned citizens with the same chance to speak in support of or against the
petitions before the Appomattox County Planning Commission or the Appomattox County Board
of Supervisors. Please note that the public hearing is not the appropriate forum to engage in
discussion of the petitions. Discussion will take place during the Planning Commission meeting
that will take place immediately following the public hearing. We will begin each petition with
comments by the petitioner, followed by comments from individuals to speak for the petition and
finally from individuals speaking against the petition. As you approach the microphone, please
