Mr. Bosiger called the recessed meeting to order at 7:25 P.M. and asked the members of
the School Board and school board administrative staff to join the Board of Supervisors.
Mr. Bosiger then asked Mr. Lannis Selz, Chairman, School Board, if he wished to begin
by presenting details on the School Boards’ proposed FY99 budget.
Mr. Selz began by saying that he understood that the Board of Supervisors had received
copies of the schools proposed budget for FY99 and that he and school board personnel
would try to answer any questions that the members of the Board of Supervisors may
have.
A lengthy question and answer session followed with the School Board addressing any
questions of the members of the Board of Supervisors.
At 8:30 P.M., being no further questions for the School Board, Mr. Bosiger thanked them
for their time.
Mr. Bosiger then turned the Boards attention to the proposed FY99 budget and budget
review continued with the following changes proposed:
Life Insurance premiums were deducted from each department, due to the State
giving a holiday from premiums to State and local governments.

budgets due to funding from the State.

State.
