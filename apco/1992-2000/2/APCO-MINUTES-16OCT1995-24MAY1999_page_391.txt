After a discussion on the funding request from Social Services, Mr. Carter was asked to
study this request and report back to the Board at a later date.
Mr. Bosiger then asked the Board of Supervisors if they wished to address the issue of
the high school roof replacement.
After a lengthy discussion, Mr. Moore made a motion seconded by Mr. Torrence to allow
the School Board to proceed with the high school roof project, with the understanding the
School Board will use the funds in the School Capitol Improvement Fund, and the Board
of Supervisors appropriating the balance. Vote: Mr. Bosiger, aye; Mr. Carter, aye; Mr.
Moore, aye; Mr. Torrence, aye.
Mr. Bosiger next presented a letter from the Town of Appomattox informing the Board
they had voted not to become members of the I.D.A. although they did agree to
participate in a water/sewer agreement with the County.
Mr. Bosiger then explained to the other members of the Board that a request had been
made from Crime Stoppers for funding to assist with their project. Mr. Bosiger asked if it
would be appropriate to consider this request during the budget discussions?
By consensus of the Board, it was agreed to consider the funding request for Crime
Stoppers during budget sessions.
Mr. Bosiger called for any other business.
Mr. Torrence made a motion at 9:40 P.M., seconded by Mr. Moore to recess until 7:00
P.M. on April 7, 1998. Vote: Mr. Bosiger, aye; Mr. Carter, aye; Mr. Moore, aye; Mr.
Torrence, aye.
