Mr. Bosiger next asked the Board for dates to tour Virginia Fibre.
Several dates in April were chosen.
Mr. Bosiger then asked if any Supervisor had anything to bring before the Board.
Mr. Carwile stated that he had given careful thought to the vacant seat on the Board of
Zoning Appeals and that he had come up with three names from his district to suggest for
appointment. Mr. Carwile gave the names as follows: Dale Campbell, Gary Tanner,
David Stratton.
Mr. Bosiger asked that Mrs. Ferguson provide these names to the Judge for appointment.
Mr. Carwile next stated that he was concerned with the amount of donation that the
County was making to Concord Fire Department. Mr. Carwile continued to provide
figures concerning the number of calls run by Concord Fire Department in Appomattox
County and the value that they provided to citizens in the Stonewall area. Mr. Carwile
closed that he would like to see the County donate at least $25,000.00 to this Department.
Mr. Bosiger stated that he did not disagree but there were other departments in similar
situations as the Concord Department, such as Red House, Toga, Gladstone, etc. that
should also be considered.
Being no other concerns, budget review began.
Each Supervisor voiced his concern with keeping expenses down and holding the tax rate
