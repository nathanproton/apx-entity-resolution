Mr. Bosiger called the meeting to order at 7:05 P.M. and welcomed the members of the
School Board and School Administration. Mr. Bosiger asked that the School Board join
the Board of Supervisors.
Mr. Bosiger asked Mr. Selz if he would like to begin by commenting on the schools
proposed FY2000 budget?
Mr. Selz began by providing an update on the expected State funding and presented the
Board of Supervisors with a revised FY2000 budget and revenue estimate for the schools.
After Mr. Selz’ presentation he stated he was willing to answer questions of the Board of
Supervisors.
A question and answer session followed concerning the details of the school budget.
Being nothing further for the School Board, Mr. Bosiger thanked and excused them.
Mr. Bosiger then explained that the County presently had ads in the paper for three part
time positions. The positions are as follows: maid/janitor for County buildings; recycling
position at the landfill, and a building sitter for the Community Center. Mr. Bosiger
stated that Mrs. Ferguson had wanted the Board made aware of this for their information
and input.
Discussion followed with the Board asking if the Secretary at the Community Center
could stagger her hours in order to cover the rentals of the building without incurring
over forty hours per week. Mrs. Ferguson was asked to look into this possibility.
