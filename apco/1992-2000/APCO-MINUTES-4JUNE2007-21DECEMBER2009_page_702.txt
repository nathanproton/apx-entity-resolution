Appomattox County Board of Supervisors
A RESOLUTION CREATING
THE APPOMATTOX COUNTY BROADBAND AUTHORITY
WHEREAS, access to affordable high speed data and Internet service (“broadband”) is
important for fostering economic development, improving educational opportunities and access
to quality health care, ensuring public safety, and enhancing the overall quality of life of the
citizens of the county; and
WHEREAS, many portions of the county are either underserved or completely unserved
by affordable and reliable broadband service; and
WHEREAS, due in large part to the economic challenges of deploying broadband
infrastructure in a largely rural community, the private sector alone has not been able to fulfill
this community need, and there is no indication that it will do so in the near future, and
WHEREAS, the Appomattox County Board of Supervisors has determined that it is in
the best interest of the citizens of the county to create a broadband authority in order facilitate the
deployment of affordable broadband service in unserved and underserved parts of the county to
local businesses, community organizations, local government agencies and departments, and
county residents.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Appomattox County Broadband
Authority (“Authority”) be created pursuant to the Virginia Wireless Service Authorities Act,
Chapter 54.1 of Title 15.2 of the Code of Virginia (§15.2-5431.1 et seq.) (“Act”) as a body
politic and corporate, and as an instrumentality exercising public and essential governmental
functions to provide for the public health and welfare as authorized under the Act. As required
by §15.2-5431.4 of the Code of Virginia, the Articles of Incorporation of the Authority are
hereby set forth as follows:
