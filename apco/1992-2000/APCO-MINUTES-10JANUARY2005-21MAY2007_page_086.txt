Mr. Carter stated that Gary Matthews with Diversified Ambulance Billing (DAB) has been
invited to speak at the April 18" meeting about revenue recovery to provide emergency
medical service paid personnel responding during the day time.
Many cities and counties, including Amherst County have plans in place for revenue
recovery, and funding EMS. We need a Memorandum of Understanding with the
Appomattox County Rescue Squad since they own the equipment, vehicles, supplies and
station.
