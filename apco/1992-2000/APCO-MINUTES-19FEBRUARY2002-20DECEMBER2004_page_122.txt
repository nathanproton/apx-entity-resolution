was on the charts displaying median incomes. Mr. Spencer replied that he did not know, but pointed
out that the data came directly from 2000 U. S. Census figures. Mr. Spencer added that during the
public input process, additional maps and charts would be developed and the drafts would be refined.
In some cases, information currently displayed on multiple draft maps would be combined on one
map to save space. Mr. Wilson asked about the size of the maps that would be included in the Comp
Plan, and Mr. Spencer said that they could be printed on 11" x 17" paper, folded twice over to fit
neatly with the plan binders.
Mr. O’Brien then asked for any final questions or comments. Hearing none, Mr. Spencer added that
any comments that may come up can be brought to his attention and incorporated prior to
commencement of public input sessions.
With no further discussion, Chairman O’Brien asked the governing bodies to adjourn their meetings.
Mr. Moore made a motion seconded by Mr. Carwile to adjourn. VOTE: Mr. Carwile, aye; Mr.
Kendrick, aye; Mr. Moore, aye; and Mr. Carter, aye.
