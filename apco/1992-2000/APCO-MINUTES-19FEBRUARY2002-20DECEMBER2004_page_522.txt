Ms. Taylor stated she has two concerns. The dumpster site at Vera is terrible.
People have been dumping furniture and everything else. She has on occasion
said something to people about this and they have told her they have the right
to dump items. The County needs to come to terms regarding manned sites.
The second concern is the E-911 Road Signs. She has put her road sign back up
twice. Now the sign is completely missing. She feels these signs should be
bolted together better.
Mr. Carter informed Ms. Taylor that the E-911 Coordinator is aware of the
problem and is working to correct this problem as well as replacing the missing
or down signs.
