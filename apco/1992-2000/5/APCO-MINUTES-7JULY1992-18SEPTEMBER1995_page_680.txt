Mr. Paulette called the meeting to order at 7:00 P.M. and explained the
purpose of the meeting was to gather information on 911 emergency
systems. Mr. Paulette continued that questions would be answered after
the 911 presentation. Mr. Paulette also explained this was not a
public hearing therefore this was not the appropriate forum for
comments for or against the proposed implementation of 911.
Mr. Paulette then introduced Mr. Dennis Gragg, Executive Director,
Central Virginia Planning Commission, and turned the meeting over to
Mr. Gragg for his presentation.
Mr. Gragg began by explaining there were three (3) levels for 911
development. Mr. Gragg gave the levels as basic 911, E-911, and E-911
with CAD system. Mr. Gragg continued by explaining the difference in
these three (3) options.
Mr. Gragg then covered information presented in a handout (handout on
file in the August 1995 Board File) on the cost involved with the three
(3) levels of 911 development.
After his presentation, Mr. Gragg answered questions from citizens
concerning 911.
Some of the citizen concerns were, cost, time frame for implementation
of the completed system, who would name streets, dispatch services, and
maintenance and upkeep of the system, once it is in place.
After answering questions, Mr. Gragg invited citizens to view a map
developed for E911 for another locality.
