Mr. Torrence, presiding, called the public hearing to order at 7:10
p.m. and explained the purpose of the hearing and the procedure for
making comments.
Mr. Torrence then asked Mr. Caldwell to read the first petition.
Mr. Caldwell read petition number 95-256 of Appomattox County to rezone
property from R-1 to R-2. Property is located at intersection of Route
679 and Route 645. Property fronts approximately 0.3 mile on North
side of Route 679 and approximately 0.6 mile on both sides of Route 645.
Mr. Torrence asked if anyone wished to speak in favor of this petition.
Mr. Ray Hudson came forward and gave his address as Appomattox,
Virginia. Mr. Hudson began by saying that most of the property
surrounding the property in question, was zoned A-1. He stated only
three lots, across Route 645 from this property were zoned R-1. Mr.
Hudson continued that if the Board didn’t want to rezone to R-2, he
would be satisfied with A-1.
Mr. Torrence asked for other comments.
Mr. Russell Hudson came forward and stated that he represented 48
people who are opposed to rezoning this property. Mr. Hudson presented
a petition with 48 signatures opposing rezoning from R-1 to R-2.
(Petition on file in zoning file #95-256).
Mr. Torrence asked if anyone else wished to comment on this request.
Ms. Betty Hudson spoke and stated she is opposed to the rezoning
because she did not want low income housing or mobile homes on this
property.
Mr. Torrence asked if anyone else wished to comment. Hearing no one,
Mr. Torrence asked Mr. Caldwell to read the next petition.
