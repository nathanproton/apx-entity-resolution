Mrs. Belter explained that a citizen had approached her concerning
property that adjoins theirs which has taxes owning back to 1975. Mrs.

this one parcel.
Discussion followed concerning the other parcels, approximately Sixty

After discussion, Mr. Torrence made a motion seconded by Mr. Moore, for
Mrs. Belter to have Mr. Puckett proceed with the necessary steps to
sell this one parcel and Mrs. Ferguson contact Mr. Puckett to determine
if he would be agreeable to working on the remaining sixty (60)
parcels. Vote: Mr. Paulette, aye; Mr. Carwile, aye; Mr. Moore, aye; and
