CUP06010 — Charles Rose/Curtis Morgan: Charles Rose (applicant/agent) with
permission from Curtis Morgan (owner) is requesting a Conditional Use Permit for
property located on Central Church Road (Route 694) in order to located three (3) two-
family dwellings (duplexes) on said Property. Property is Tax Map #107-(A)-14B,
containing approximately 2.00 acres and zoned A-1, Agricultural District.
Mr. Roark stated he had received a memorandum from Mr. Rose addressing
discrepancies in the narrative on the initial application as follows:
1. In paragraph one, we plan to develop two plus acres of land rather than
three. The units will have a duplex structural design versus a four-plex
design.
2. Paragraph three currently reflects a four-plex design with two (2) bedroom
units and two three bedroom units, it should reflect a duplex with two 3
bedroom units.
In closing, its been recently brought to his attention that it is more feasible and
cost effective to develop duplex units versus four-plex units for this particular
location. I would like to apologize for the last minute adjustments.
Is there anyone present who wishes to speak for this petition.
