At 6:00 p.m. Mr. Carter called the meeting together and stated the purpose of this
meeting was to receive comments regarding the Virginia Department of Transportation’s
Six Year Plan and the priorities for the 2005-2006 budget. Requests for improvements
and new additional will also be considered at this time. Mr. Carter then turned the
meeting over to Mr. Austin.
Mr. Austin introduced the draft Proposed Six Year Plan. The funding has decreased by
25% from what it was last year. This has resulted in not being able to add anything to
the plan. Basically the plan is the same as it was last year with the highest priority
being the Route 641 (Church Street) project which has been budgeted for several years.
Hopefully by 2006 all the right-of-way will have been purchased for this project.
Mr. Austin also presented the unpaved road list.
There were no requests for improvements.
