WHEREAS, in 1926, then Governor Byrd exchanged the Commonwealth's right to
impose a real estate tax for local government's agreement to give up the right to
impose an income tax; and,
WHEREAS, the real estate tax is the primary source of local income, at an
average of 48% of all local revenues collected statewide; and,
WHEREAS, as the principal source of income for local government, localities rely
heavily on this source of income to meet federal and state mandates for services,
especially education and public safety; and,
WHEREAS, two of the candidates in the 2005 election for Governor of the
Commonwealth (former Attorney General Jerry Kilgore and Lt. Governor Tim
Kaine) have stated as a high priority for their respective campaigns the
imposition of an assessment or other limitations on the residential component of
the real estate tax, which would severely restrict localities and would constitute a
breach of trust from the agreement reached in 1926; and
WHEREAS, the proposal from either candidate would weaken budget discipline,
since support for services would not necessarily be linked to the responsibility to
pay for them, and could potentially force a greater dependence on taxation of
the business sector to support local services, thereby harming economic
development in the Commonwealth; and
WHEREAS, in 1997, in the campaign for Governor, then candidate James
Gilmore used as the cornerstone for his campaign, the repeal of the personal
property tax on non-business use motor vehicle, which is credited with his
winning the office; and,
WHEREAS, the cost to the citizens was greatly underestimated, which has since
led the General Assembly to place a cop on the state's commitment to make its
payments to localities under this plan;
NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that the Appomattox County Board of
Supervisors calls upon these two gubernatorial candidates, and upon all
candidates for state and federal office, to refrain from establishing local tax
policy at the state or federal level, due to the potential negative impact such
action may have on the ability of local government to deliver local services; and
FURTHER, should a candidate or legislator desire to impact tax policy as it relates
to the real estate or other local tax, that the candidate or legislator use as the
tool to address such policy tax credits or deductions to state or federal income
taxes in lieu of enacting limitations on local taxing authority; and
FURTHER, that it is imperative for local government to retain sole control over
the decisions which determine equity of local taxation policy, if governing bodies
are to effectively address local service needs.
