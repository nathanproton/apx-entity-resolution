13. Supervisor Concerns:
Mr. Conrad stated we have looking at ways to bring more tourism and to keep
people in our community and utilize our services. He has been approached by
several people during the last couple of months regarding the approval of liquor
by the drink in the County. This might create some enticement to bring more
business into the area. He does not have any format on this, he assumes it has
to go through Richmond. He feels this may be something the Board may want
to discuss in the near future.
Mr. Overstreet will look into the Code to see what step have to be taken before
the Board considers this.
No one else had any concerns to present at this time.
Mr. Carter reminded the Board Members of the upcoming meetings.
