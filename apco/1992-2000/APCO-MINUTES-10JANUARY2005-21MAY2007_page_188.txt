Mr. Carter next called Tom Zaebst, Department of Forestry to address the Board.
Mr. Zaebst stated he is meeting with the Board to give a report on the annual forest
harvesting. They harvested 106 acres of pine thinning and 239 acres of timber
harvesting. He stated that the markets have not been the greatest since a lot of the
market is going oversees, especially China. There is still an issue with the Gypsy Moth
but not as great as in the past. The Pine Beetle is not a problem this year. He has
some concern regarding a fungal/Asian disease known as Sudden Oak Death, first found
in California, that may spread to our area. There is some concern about the Eastern
Hemlock Bug. The largest threat to the forestry industry at this time is Urban
Development. Mr. Zeabst also presented the County with a check in the amount of
$44,133.70 which represents Appomattox County's share of the forest harvest.
Mr. Carter then presented the INFORMATIONAL ITEMS: (Items 13-15)
