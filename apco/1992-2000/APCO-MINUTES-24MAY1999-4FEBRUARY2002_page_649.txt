At 7:04 P.M. Mr. Kendrick opened the Joint Public Hearing and stated to those in attendance that the
Public Hearing is not the appropriate forum to engage in discussion on the petitions. Discussion will
take place during the Planning Commission meeting that will immediately follow the public meeting
in the Jury Room off to the right. We will begin a hearing of each petition with comments by the
petitioner, followed by comments from individuals to speak for the petition and finally by
individuals wishing to speak against the petition. As you approach the microphone, please state your
name, address and whether you are for or against the petition.
Mr. Kendrick then turned the meeting over to Mr. Brandon Stidham, County Planner.
The following petitions were then presented.
01-488. Gray S. Nash, t/a Nash Auto & Equipment. Amend conditional use permit per §74-

460 and Rt. 24, Tax Map #64A3(A)1, and is zoned B-1.

between Rt. 689 and U.S. 460 East, Tax Map #62(A)45, 46, 52, 53, and 66A, and are currently zoned
R-1.
Harrison Kelso (P.O. Box 440, Spout Spring) spoke on behalf of his petition. The property used to
have a trailer sited on it at one time, now wants to place a new trailer on the property. The property
is currently zoned for modular homes, but he would like permission to site a trailer. He added that if
he cannot site a regular trailer [single-wide mobile home], that he would have no problem siting a
double-wide mobile home instead.
James Brotherton (Rt. 2 Box 4, Spout Spring) spoke against the petition. He is opposed to the re-
