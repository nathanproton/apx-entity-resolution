Zoning & Subdivision: No changes. We would love to hire a Planner, but cannot afford to do so
at this time.
Capitol Projects Fund: This was left out last year. Ms. Ferguson has included $380,000.00 -
This is something we do not have to do.

Cafeteria Budget: $869,196.00
Total: $20,126,549.00
There was some discussion regarding the Budget for the School.
Social Services have not submitted their budget. Figures from last year were used in order to
come up with total for the FY 06 Budget.
After figuring in the total budget and the total projected revenue, we have a budget shortfall of
$2,959,885.00
Ms. Ferguson has suggested that all changes be made on the copy of the budget that each member
currently has. A new copy will not be printed each time changes are made.
