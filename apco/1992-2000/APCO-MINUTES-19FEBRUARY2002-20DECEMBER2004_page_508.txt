SUPERVISOR CONCERNS: Mr. Carter asked if any one had a concern
they wished to discuss at this time.
Mr. Moore stated that in the construction of the new courthouse, there
are change orders that come up which need to be acted upon prior to the
next Board Meeting. Most of these items are relatively small and he is
asking the Board’s permission to allow him to approve these small change
orders when they arise. September is fast approaching and we cannot
afford to lose time in getting these things done. A report would be given
at the next Board meeting.
Mr. Craft stated he trusted Mr. Moore’s judgment and was in favor of granting
him blanket authority to handle these matters.
