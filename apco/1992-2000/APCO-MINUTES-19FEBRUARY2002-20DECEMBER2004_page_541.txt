Association: Mr. Johnson began by stating that he was the new Executive
Director of the Roanoke River Basin Association, having began in January. They
are a non-profit, non government organization started in 1945. They represent
the river (they consider themselves a friend of the river) from Roanoke to the
Albemarle Sound in North Carolina. They support many watershed initiatives.
Their primary objective is to fight against inter-basin transfer of water.
Mr. Conrad asked how this association differed from the governmental agencies
that set up programs for the proper use of our water ways?

common man, the grassroots individuals within the basin. Falling River is a part
of the Roanoke River Basin.
