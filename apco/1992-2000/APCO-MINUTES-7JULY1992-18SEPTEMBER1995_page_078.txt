Aden. This includes a tractor, driver, and fuel to pick up
the trash at Appomattox and deliver it to Amelia. The trash
would be loaded into trailers owned by the County and the
County would still have to collect from the "green box" sites
and transport the trash to a transfer site likely located at
the site of the current landfill. Therefore, cost for
collection would still be $60,185 divided by 11,000 tons per
year or $5.47 per ton.
Draper Aden figured a transfer station would cost about $5.95
per ton authorized for 20 years. Mr. Jamerson felt this
figure was high if the transfer site were to be constructed
at the site of the current landfill because the existing
access road could be used, the County already owns the
property, and site work would be less than what Draper Aden
had considered.
Mr. Jamerson further explained about $1,000,000.00 of the
Bond money would or has been spent closing the existing
landfill and complying with the consent decree. Therefore,
debt repayment would be about half of that currently
anticipated or $257,942.00 divided by 2 divided by 11,000
tons per year equals $11.72 per ton.
Labor cost to operate the transfer station would be about
$94,500.00 per year divided by 11,000 tons equals $8.60 per
ton. This includes salary for four (4) people to bale
recyclables, load trailers, operate scales, supervise
collections and transfer station operations, etc. The $8.60
does not include utility expenses, supplies, repair costs,
etc.
The total cost then if the County were to use the private
landfill at Amelia would be $29.00 + $9.00 + $5.47 + $5.95 +
$11.72 + $8.60 or $69.74 per ton. However, the County would
continue to collect from business and industrial users at the
same rate or $47,333 (Billings for first quarter FY93)
Givided by 2,750 tons per quarter equals $17.21 and $69.74
minus $17.21 = $52.53. Even though the $5.95 per ton cost to
construct a transfer station is probably high and the $8.60
per ton to operate the transfer station is a little low, the
$52.53/ton compares with the $47.19/ton using budgeted costs
and the $42.65/ton using actual first quarter FY93 expenses.
Mr. Torrence asked if the Town of Pamplin’s garbage
collection would be affected by any of the options. Mr.
Jamerson assured Mr. Torrence Pamplin’s garbage would be
handled the same way as it is currently, i.e. the Town pays
to have the garbage and trash picked up at no additional cost
to the residents. The trash would then be either delivered
to the transfer site or to the landfill. Mr. Jamerson added
that the figures did not reflect any proceeds’ from
recyclables. However, these would be minor and affect all
three (3) options the same since the recycling is to continue
under either plan.
Mr. Torrence asked if the liability aspects of dumping trash
had been considered assuming a private landfill was used and
