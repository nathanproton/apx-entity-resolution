At 7:00 p.m. Mr. Carter called the work session to order and gave the invocation.
Ms. Ferguson stated there is never good news when it comes to the budget. Everything

However, we need to add these items:
1. The gas remediation system for the landfill will cost at least $500,000.
2. Additional request today to put on a full-time CSA Coordinator. If that happens,
in addition to salary, benefits, etc., we will need another vehicle as this person
