Chairman Craft reconvened the recessed meeting of May 19, 2008 at 6:00 p.m. on May
21, 2008, and asked everyone to join in a moment of silence.
Chairman Craft opened the meeting and stated that this meeting was being held to discuss
the Route 460 Waterline.
Mr. Carter stated that when sending a counter offer back to the Town, he would like to
suggest that the County offer the following:
The County will pay 100% while the Town’s resources that they currently have, can stay
in place for operation, maintenance and meter readings for this waterline.
One rate would be used for all residential customers no matter if they live in or out of
town.
The water system in total must pay for itself. No raiding the General Fund to pay for
shortages in the water fund. No request will be considered by the County to help offset
water fund shortages during any upcoming year.
The maintenance of all water lines is to be sole responsibility of the Town by using the
STAGG Grant.
Ms. Ferguson stated that it is her understanding that the STAGG Grant can be used only
for new construction or maintenance of what the Town already has in the ground.
A Utility Committee will need to be established and include two members from the
Board of Supervisors which will be chosen by the Chairman of the Board.
