can effectively be accomplished by an ordinance or if it believes that the County
should expend 911 tax funds to produce and install structure signs at each
residence and business in the County. (The Towns of Pamplin and Appomattox
would have to make their own determination regarding these signs.) The
Committee may make a recommendation to the Board for consideration. Staff
