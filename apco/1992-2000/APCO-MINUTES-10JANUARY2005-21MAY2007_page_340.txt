Mr. Perrow stated that these boilers are early 1980's vintage and one leaks and has a
blow by problem. Replacement would involve some engineering work because the
newer models are smaller and more efficient.
Mr. Waddell commented that the boilers were considered for replacement when the
school was renovated, but not done because they were relatively new, but strides have
been made in efficiency.
Mr. Carter said the Board of Supervisors wants to work with the School Board to come
up with ways to be proactive.
Dr. Krug challenged Mr. Carter’s data from earlier. He said that the schools didn’t report
things equally. He stated that Appomattox reported office staff, but other counties did
not include theirs. Appomattox probably has eight (8) professionals on Administrative
staff, not 23, but he will check on this.
Mr. Conrad wanted everyone to know that the Board of Supervisors does care, but
unfunded mandates really “arrests” the Board's ability to do the right this.
At 8:30 p.m. Ms. Martin made a motion, seconded by Mr. Todd to adjourn the School
Board.
AT 8:31 p.m. Mr. Craft made a motion, seconded by Mr. Conrad, to adjourn the Board of
Supervisors. VOTE: Mr. Conrad, aye; Mr. Craft, aye; Mr. Moore, aye; and Mr. Carter,
aye. (4 aye votes — 1 absent)
