Staff is recommending that the Board receive the report of the proposed budget
and accept the Budget Workplan. Also set the Real Estate Tax rate for 2003 and
set the tax collection deadline date for June 25, 2003.
Mr. Carroll presented each member with a notebook containing all information pertinent
to the FY 2004 budget, including line items for the revenue, line items for the
expenditures as well as a copy of the departmental requests as submitted to the County
Administrator’s office.
The main goal of the budget process this year was to maintain the current real estate tax
rate at .66 cent per $100 assessed value; maintain the funding of essential services;
mitigate the impact of State budget reductions; maintain sound financial practices by
building the CIP Fund and maintaining the General Fund Reserve. The proposed budget
as received tonight, is balanced, with no increases in real estate rate, no increase in
personal property rate and with no increase in the fee structure.
The total local revenue is $9,104,407. These are essentially flat. There may have been
an increase of $8,000 or $9,000 total from last year. Real estate rates or real estate tax
may have increased minimally. Personal property from the Commissioner of Revenue
decreased. | State Corporation Commission real estate and personal property also
decreased. These are probably the biggest things impacting the budget.
After some discussion Mr. Kendrick made a motion seconded by Mr. Moore to set the tax
rate at $.66 per $100 assessed value and extend the tax collection deadline date to June
25, 2003 for Real Estate. VOTE: Mr. Hancock, aye; Mr. Carwile, aye; Mr. Moore, aye;
Mr. Kendrick, aye; and Mr. Carter, aye. (5 aye votes)
