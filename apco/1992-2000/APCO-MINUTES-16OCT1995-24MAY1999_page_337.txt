We have lived on Court Street over 56 years and have owned our home for 42 years. We
strongly oppose rezoning this end of Court Street, as it would not only devalue our
property but at our age (85 & 82) cause too much confusion.
We are not able to go out at night, so please accept this note as our vote against rezoning.

Thank you for your consideration.
