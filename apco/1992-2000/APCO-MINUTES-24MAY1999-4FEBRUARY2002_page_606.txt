14. Health Insurance Premiums: Line item transfer of $33,810.00 to cover health insurance
premium increase for County employees. Also Health Department is requesting to retain
$6,898.23 in excess local revenue funds from FY2001 Budget. Approval of the Consent
Agenda would deny the Health Department’s request.
15. IDA Bond: Transfer $21,585.70 plus any additional interest accrued from the IDA Bond
Account to the general revenue fund to pay for qualified budgeted expense (sheriff's car),
thus closing this account.
Mr. Kendrick called for concerns regarding the Consent Agenda items.
Mr. Carter stated he had a question regarding item 14. He feels the Health Department should be
allowed to retain the $6,898.23 from the FY 2001 Budget. He would like to see this investigated
further to see if there is some way to fund the insurance premium increase from elsewhere.
Mr. Kendrick questioned why they did not use these funds during the last fiscal period.
Mr. Moore agrees with Mr. Carter but he is concerned about dipping from some place else.
Somewhere along the line we are going to come up short.
Mr. Carwile stated he feels Mr. Moore’s conservative views are appreciated.
After some discussion, Mr. Kendrick made a motion seconded by Mr. Carter to approve the
Consent Agenda with the exception of Item #14 - Health Insurance Premiums. This item will
tabled until the next Board meeting. VOTE: Mr. Kendrick, aye; Mr. Carter, aye; Mr. Hancock,
aye; Mr. Carwile, aye; and Mr. Moore, aye.
