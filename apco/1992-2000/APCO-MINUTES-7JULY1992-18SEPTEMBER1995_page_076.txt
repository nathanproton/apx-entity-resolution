Deere wood chipper. After further discussion, the vote was:
Mr. Jamerson, aye; Mrs. Beasley, aye; Mr. Carwile, aye; Mr.
Moore, aye; Mr. Torrence, aye.
Mr. Jamerson asked Mr. Garrett to furnish, for the County’s
files, copies of the two (2) written quotations he has
received for this machinery. Further, Mr. Jamerson suggested
the County ask the Town to add the chipper to their casualty
insurance policy since they have more equipment and a larger
policy. The Board agreed to these provisions by consensus
with no opposition.
Mr. Jamerson thanked and excused Mr. Garrett and next
addressed the Board explaining his recent analysis of the
three (3) options the Board had been considering for waste
disposal - a regional facility in conjunction with Nelson and
Buckingham Counties, closing the Appomattox County Landfill
and shipping the County’s solid waste to the proposed private
landfill in Amelia County, and continuing to operate and
modernize the County’s landfill to be used exclusively by the
citizens and businesses of Appomattox County. Mr. Jamerson
noted he had consulted with Messers. Peterson and Rice
jointly last Monday on the figures he was presenting. Mr.
Jamerson furnished copies of his calculations to each Board
member as follows:
