5. Naming Road into Community Park: The Appomattox Community Park
Committee would like permission to name the new road going into the park
“Kruschwitz Boulevard” in appreciation of all the work Fred Kruschwitz has
donated at the park.
Mr. Conrad made a motion, seconded by Mr. Moore, to name the road going into the
new Appomattox Community Park “Kruschwitz Boulevard” in appreciation of all the work
Fred Kruschwitz has contributed to this project. VOTE: Mr. Armbrust, aye; Mr. Conrad,

6. Appomattox County Rescue Squad: The Appomattox County Rescue Squad
is requesting the Board consider donating $20,000.00 toward the cost of their
new truck. This request was included in the FY2004 budget but due to the fact
that the rescue squad grant was not approved until after June 30, 2004, they
were unable to access these funds. This donation was contingent on the rescue
squad receiving grant funds from the State.
Since these funds were included in the FY 2004 budget and were never expended, Mr.
Craft made a motion, seconded by Mr. Conrad, to approve the Appomattox County
Rescue Squad’s request for $20,000.00 toward the purchase of a new truck and
supplement the FY2005 budget for this same amount. ROLL CALL VOTE: Mr. Armbrust,
aye; Mr. Conrad, aye; Mr. Craft, aye; Mr. Moore, aye; and Mr. Carter, aye. (5 aye
votes)
Mr. Carter next called for action on the Consent Agenda: (Items 7-15)
