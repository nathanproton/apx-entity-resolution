The Board by consensus added the cabinetry to the “punch list” with a completion date
of September 5, 2004.
Darryl Puckett’s Security Wall: The area designated for the secretary is basically
one large room with no means of privacy for their files, the VCIN computer system and
other documents and/or equipment that must be secured and not assessable to the
public. The Commonwealth’s Attorney had requested a wall similar to the security walls
in the courtrooms and it was determined that this was not necessary. Mr. Puckett, Ms.
Williams, and Ms. Ferguson have looked at this again and have determined that a half
wall with a locked door would be sufficient. Mr. Jackson had given him a tentative price
of approximately $500 for this. Is this something the Board would consider approving, if
so Ms. Ferguson will ask Mr. Jackson for a price. This is not something that has to be
done within the time frame of completion.
Mr. Craft stated that the information on the VCIN system is extremely confidential and
could create serious problems if this information was to be accidently viewed by
unauthorized persons.
The Board authorized Ms. Ferguson to obtain a cost for the construction of this security
wall.
At 5:49 p.m. Mr. Moore made a motion, seconded by Mr. Armbrust, to adjourn. VOTE:
Mr. Armbrust, aye; Mr. Conrad, aye; Mr. Craft, aye; Mr. Moore, aye; and Mr. Carter, aye.
