Comprehensive Services - This budget is growing, and growing. They are all mandated
and we cannot do anything about these. We are reimbursed for about 70% of this
$550,000. This reimbursement is shown on the revenue side of the budget.
Contributions — we did not put in any thing that was not in the budget for last year. We
got a lot of requests for donations. After Prom Party $200 donation needs to be added.
Also add $1,500 for the Railroad Festival; $1,000 for the American Legion; Trans
Dominion Express $500 and $1,200 to AWAG.
Debt Service — increases are for renovations to Administration Building, the old
Elementary School, and Gas Extraction System. Also if we continue to use the landfill
we will need to purchase a new piece of equipment.
Economic Development — increase is a grant. Concerning the Web-Site, we will need to
purchase a Domain and some maintenance.
Extension Services — this did not change much, even though they have a new position.
School Board Budget - we have included the entire budget that was submitted at the
last meeting. We still do not have the Cafeteria budget in this. This is an increase of
$265,000 of local funds. They will not get their final budget before we have to adopt
our budget.

see where adjustments can be made. If we adopt the Land Use Program, that is

There was some discussion regarding the tax rate and the re-assessment. There are

only way to keep taxes down is to have more industry.
