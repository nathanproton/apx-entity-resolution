Mrs. Ferguson, read a letter from the Appomattox Extension Leadership
Council requesting a resolution of support to ask the United Way of
Central Virginia to include Appomattox County in their agency.
After discussion, and by consensus of the Board of Supervisors, Mrs.
Ferguson was directed to ask Dennis Gragg and Franklin Vaughan to
attend the July 1994 Board meeting, to provide further information on
this subject.
A request for resolution of support to Senator Robb urging him to
co-sponsor Senator Kempthornes bill against unfunded mandates, was
presented next.
Mr. Carwile made a motion seconded by Mr. Paulette to adopt the
following resolution:
RESOLUTION
REQUESTING SENATOR CHARLES ROBB TO CO-SPONSOR S. 993
IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
WHEREAS, S.993 has been introduced in the Senate of the United States
by the Honorable Dirk Kempthorne of Idaho; and
WHEREAS, Senator Kempthorne’s S.993 will require the federal government
to pay for the mandates that they impose on state and local governments
and establish a fiscal note process so that when Congress votes on
various measures affecting state and local governments, the members of
Congress are aware of the fiscal impact; and
ti—ct
WHEREAS, S.993 is the most significant and far-reaching unfunded
mandates legislation ever introduced in the Congress of the Unites
States; and
WHEREAS, as of May 1, 1994, Senator Kempthrone’s bill had received 54
out of 100 Senate co-sponsors; and
WHEREAS, Senator John Warner of Virginia has already displayed his
commitment to this issue by signing on to S.993; and
WHEREAS, although Senator Charles Robb has communicated his concern
about unfunded mandates and has indicated that he "fully endorses the
concept of identifying and restricting unfunded federal mandates;, to
date he has declined to co-sponsor S.993; and
WHEREAS, a recent NACo survey estimated that a minimum of 12 percent of
local budgets support unfunded federal mandates; and
WHEREAS, unfunded federal mandates regularly force local tax increases
and/or service cutbacks, restrict the rights of state and local voters
and officials to determine their own priorities, and allow the Congress
to avoid direct responsibility for increasing taxes; and
