At 7:00 p.m. Mr. Carter called the Board of Supervisors meeting to order and welcomed
everyone in attendance. Mr. Carter further stated that he looked forward to a very
productive meeting.
At 7:01 p.m. Mr. Waddell called the School Board meeting to order and stated he
certainly appreciated the Board of Supervisors cooperation in the past, present and
looked forward to the future and hoped that the discussion tonight will be helpful to
everyone.
Dr. Krug stated that before the meeting gets started that he hoped everyone had
received a flyer from him regarding the Meeting on Youth to be held on March 30".
He would encourage everyone to attend if at all possible. The speaker will be from the
Office of the Attorney General.
Dr. Krug thanked the Board for their cooperation and the allocation of unspent funds
that occurred last year. As you will recall, in June, they received some late funding that
they were unable to spend by the end of the fiscal year and the Board graciously agreed
to allocate these funds to the budget for this year in support of our schools.
