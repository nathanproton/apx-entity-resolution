On April 23, 2001 at 6:00 P.M. the Appomattox County Board of Supervisors held a Budget
Work Session at the Appomattox County Courthouse, Courthouse Square, Court Street,
Appomattox, VA. 24522
PRESENT:
Jerry G. Kendrick - Chairman - Appomattox River District
Samuel E. Carter - Courthouse District
Frank H. Carwile - Wreck Island District
Russell H. Moore - Piney Mountain District
ABSENT:
Jesse Hancock - Falling River District
ALSO PRESENT:
Andy Carroll - County Administrator
At 6:05 P.M. Mr. Kendrick reconvened a recessed meeting from April 16", 2001 and asked Mr.
Carter to give the invocation.
Mr. Kendrick stated there was one item for discussion held over from the recessed meeting. He
asked if everyone had had the opportunity to look over the Modified Redistricting Schedule.
Mr. Carroll briefly discussed the schedule with the Presentation to the Board on May 7"; if the
Board is happy with that presentation a Resolution by the Board accepting the Redistricting Plan
for a Public Hearing to be held on May 21“ should be passed at this time. The notice of the
public hearing would be published in the newspaper on May 9" and May 16". We generally do
not accept what comes out of a public hearing on the date of the hearing but due to time restraints
we could adopt the Plan if there are no comments made that give the Board concern. The Board
could however, schedule a meeting for later that same week to adopt a different Redistricting
Plan. After this, we need to submit the Plan to the County Attorney.
Mr. Carter made a motion seconded by Mr. Carwile to accept the Redistricting Schedule as
presented. VOTE: Mr. Kendrick, aye; Mr. Carter, aye; Mr. Carwile, aye; and Mr. Moore, aye.
Mr. Kendrick turned the meeting over to Mr. Carroll for Budget discussion.
