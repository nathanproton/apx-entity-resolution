they desire and consider making appointments at the next meeting. Suggested members from:
Board of Supervisors, School Board, Citizens Forum (2) and concerned citizens (1-3).
Mr. Kendrick suggested that the Board give some thought to not only choosing the committee
members but what exactly we want the committee to do. What is our objective? Do we have some
ideas ourselves that might need to be explored as well as citizen input. The primary goal should be
that whatever the use, it be self-sustaining.
After some discussion it was decided that each member will give thought to this matter and be
prepared to discuss again at the meeting on the 20". Also the County Administrator should get in
touch with the current chairman of the Citizen’s Forum regarding their status.
4. State Visitor’s Guide: Mr. Brian Knopp of the Lynchburg Chamber has asked that we
participate in placing an ad in the State Visitor’s Guide. A 1/4 page ad would cost the
County $3,500.00 with the other portion of the ad being paid by a VTC Grant the Lynchburg
Chamber has received.. The County has advertised in this guide before and they have a
circulation of approximately 750,000. There are funds budgeted for tourism.
After much discussion as to the need for this type of advertising, Mr Kendrick made a motion
seconded by Mr. Moore that the Board appropriate $3,500.00 for the VTC Visitor’s Guide.
VOTE: Mr. Kendrick, aye; Mr. Carter, aye; Mr. Hancock, aye; Mr. Carwile, aye; and Mr. Moore,
aye.
