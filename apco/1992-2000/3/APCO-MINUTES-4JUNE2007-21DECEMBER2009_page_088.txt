Amend Section 170-34-Conditional Uses, Agricultural District, A-I |
Add Automotive Repair Garages, Mechanical and Body Shops to the list of
conditional uses.
Add to the list of conditional uses: Storage of Sewage Sludge, expressly subject to
the requirements of the Appomattox County Code Chapter 140-Land Application
of Biosolids and §32.1-164.5 et seq. and §62.1-44.19:3 et seq. of the Code of
Virginia (1950) as amended, and such other applicable County, Federal , and
State statutes, ordinances, and regulations as may be adopted from time to time.
However, a conditional use permit shall not be required to begin the storage of
sewage sludge on property in an A-1 zoning district as long as such sewage
Sludge is being stored (a) solely for land application on the farm on which the
storage facility is located and (b) for a period no longer than forty-five (45) days.
Below you will find a proposed amendment to the Land Application of Biosolids
Ordinance. The amendment is in conjunction with the proposed amendment to
the zoning ordinance and is a result of legislation passed by the General
Assembly. The amendment is as follows: (amended text is in italics)
The origin of this request was through an act by the General Assembly this past year

coming in to a farm and storing loads and loads of sludge to be placed elsewhere in the
County. This type of storage will need to have a Conditional Use Permit.
