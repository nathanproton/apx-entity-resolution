At 7:06 P.M. Mr. Moore called the Public Hearing to order and stated the purpose of this hearing
was to receive public comments on zoning petitions. Mr. Moore then stated the procedure for
addressing comments.
Mr. Moore then asked Mr. Sears to read the first petition:
00-425 - Courtland Realty - Rezone property from A-1 to R-2. Property is part of Tax Map #64-A-
35 and is located on Route 691 between Route 719 and Route T-1008.
Mr. Moore called for comments for or against this petition.
Mrs. Nina Beasley came forward and gave her address as P O. Box 192, Appomattox, Va. She is
not against this petition but she does have some questions. Is this going to be a sub-division? Will
there be any restrictions on these lots. If I bought an acre lot could I put two or three trailers on it?
She is concerned because this property runs beside and behind her property.
