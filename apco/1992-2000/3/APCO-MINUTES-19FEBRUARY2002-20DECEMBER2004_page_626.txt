provided operating costs for some of the surrounding counties and their solid waste management
plans.
Mr. Dickerson stated that this is more complicated that what we all had imagined. He also stated
that the success that the County has at the landfill is due to Mrs. Rockefellow and her staff. They
have succeeded in making the baler do what the baling company said it would do. You can
design and draw on paper all day, but you have to have an operator and staff to make it work.
Mr. Dickerson presented a bound hardcopy of this information to each member present at the
close of his presentation.
After a question and answer period, Mr. Carter thanked and excused Mr. Dickerson.
Mr. Dickerson further stated that even though Part “A” has been approved, if you proceed with
the cell, it would take three (3) or four (4) months to get a design completed and submitted to
DEQ. It would be at least a year before anything could be done.
Ms. Ferguson stated that time is of the essence for a decision on this issue.
At 8:26 p.m. Mr. Conrad made a motion, seconded by Mr. Craft to adjourn until August 23, 2004
at 5:00 p.m. This meeting will be held at the Office of the County Administrator. VOTE: Mr.
Armbrust, aye; Mr. Conrad, aye; Mr. Craft, aye; Mr. Moore, aye; and Mr. Carter, aye. (5 aye
