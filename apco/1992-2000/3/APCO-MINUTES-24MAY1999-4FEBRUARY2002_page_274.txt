The use of such a weapon is demeaning to the skills of expert hunters. This would also lessen thesportsmanship of hunting.
I recall that my deceased husband, John T. Paulette, who was an avid hunter was opposed to thismanner of hunting. Some of his deceased friends were also in Opposition to this. James Ford wasone of them. Having been in law enforcement and an experienced hunter makes his opinion ofvalue.
Criminals who get their hands on such weapons will cause great problems with guns so powerful.
Young and inexperienced hunters will find such power awesome and heartache will often occur.
You may say post our land. Sure! But what about those who hunt without permission and they do.We know from experience of seeing and hearing their shots that this does happen.
Please voice my concern as my representative.
Sincerely,
Yvonne F. Paulette
