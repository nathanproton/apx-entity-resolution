Mr. Carter then called for consideration of the Administrative Items: (items 1-7)
1. VPSA Bond: SUPPLEMENTAL RESOLUTION - Mr. Carroll explained the
changes in this resolution were due to changes that the Bond Counsel for VPSA made on
Friday. We were not able to get these changes in the Board Book until today as we need
to consider these changes before adopting this resolution. This supplemental resolution
was necessary to clarify the difference between the subsidized portion for $7.5 million
and the unsubsidized portion for $1.850 million.
After some discussion, Mr. Moore made a motion seconded by Mr. Carter to adopt the
VPSA Supplemental Resolution as follows:
