7. Petition on Container Site on Route 627: Supervisor Craft has provided
petitions with signatures requesting that the Board of Supervisors not close the
container site on Route 627.
Recommendation: Staff recommends reviewing petitions.
Mr. Craft has talked with the people who started this petition. The signatures are from
people who usually use this container site. He took the map we used to decide what we
were going to do. It showed how far people in Promise Land, Spring Mills have to drive
as well as those from Bent Creek and Oakville, the people around Holiday Lake and he
thinks it satisfied them somewhat. They did ask why you picked Route 620 over them,
He told them it was based on the numbers.
