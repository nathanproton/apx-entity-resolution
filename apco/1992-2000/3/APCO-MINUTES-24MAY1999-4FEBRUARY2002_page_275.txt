Most of the counties that allow rifles for deer hunting do not allow the use of dogs or don’t have asmuch of a problem with hunters shooting from the road at deer being chased by dogs.
Those that say that rifles are no different from Black Powder have not stated that Black Powderseason does not allow the use of dogs and that Black Powder range is much shorter than rifles usedfor deer hunting.
Even though shooting from the road is illegal, the problem that currently exists will likely get worse.The longer range of the rifles will allow for more opportunities for those that do shoot from the road.Rifle proponents say they should not be punished for the illegal hunters but why should thelandowner be required to deal with the problem?
People do get shot with rifles. During the 1998 season a Campbell County man was shot in his ownback yard when a rifle was used to shoot at a running deer.
There are many people that are unfamiliar with the area that come to hunt in Appomattox County.When they pull up in a truck, I hate to think that person may be getting ready to use a rifle to shootat a running deer.
Please consider your decision well and weigh the privilege of the hunter using a rifle against thelandowners feeling of safety on their own property.
Sincerely,
Hunter Marshall
