telegraph services within the County, for the privilege of doing business within the

Sec.147-53 Effective Date
This ordinance shall be effective at 12:01 A.M. on J: anuary 1, 2001.
Mr. Moore then asked if any wished to address either of these ordinances.
Mr. Evans Thomas, Rt. 4, Box 227, Appomattox, VA came forward. Mr. Thomas has concerns withArticle 17 of the E911 Ordinance. It is time for Appomattox County to have a E911 service.
Especially when the other surrounding counties already have 911. This service will improve thequality of services that we already have in Appomattox County.
Mr. Thomas’ main concern is from the standpoint of a small business being taxed $3.00/line. This
would cost his firm approximately $216.00/year for their various lines, including fax lines. On a
$30.00 per month phone bill this will amount to a 30% increase. He feels that for a small business
with more than two lines, that they only need one line for E911 service. He asks that any tax that islevied, have a limit. Any consideration that can be given to this will be greatly appreciated.
Mr. W. H. Craft, Route 2, Appomattox, Va came forward and stated that he is all for the E911
system and hopes that as soon as the system is in place, that the Board will be able to reduce this tax.
Mr. Moore stated that due to the fact that we are getting a late start on this mandated system, we needthe money up front to be able to get this project completed by the dead line. Hopefully sometimein the future we may be able to reduce this amount of taxation.
Mr. Moore called for other comments.
Hearing none, at 6:38 P.M. Mr. Moore closed the Public Hearing.
