Mr. Craft asked it this was basically what we had before, with the exception in the
change in the name.
Ms. Ferguson stated there was to be no change in the Lease, just the format because
instead of an LLC leasing the building, it will be a Board of Directors. Things have to be
done a little different according to Mr. Overstreet.
