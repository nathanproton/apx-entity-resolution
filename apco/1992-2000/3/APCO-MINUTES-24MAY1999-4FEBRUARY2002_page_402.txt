Mr. Carter made a motion seconded by Mr. Kendrick to reappoint Mrs. Virginia Fratrick to the
CVAAA Advisory Board for another term. VOTE: Mr. Moore, aye; Mr. Kendrick, aye; Mr.

The Board has received a request from America’s Promise requesting a $400.00 donation to
underwrite the cost of the Region 2000 Community of Promise Celebration on October 27, 2000.
Mr. Kendrick suggested that the Board table this item until it can be determined if a donation was
made in previous years. The Board by consensus decided to table this until more information has
been made available.
At the last meeting Mr. Carroll asked if the Board wanted to have the power to grant a special
exception for zoning cases that do not fit within our current zoning ordinance. Mr. Stidham has
prepared data which explains when such special exceptions may arise. A public hearing will be
necessary to make a change in the current zoning ordinance.
Mr. Carwile made a motion seconded by Mr. Kendrick to set a public hearing date of November 20,
2000 to receive comments on a change to the zoning ordinance. VOTE: Mr. Moore, aye; Mr.
Kendrick, aye; Mr. Hancock, aye; Mr. Carwile, aye; and Mr. Carter, aye.
