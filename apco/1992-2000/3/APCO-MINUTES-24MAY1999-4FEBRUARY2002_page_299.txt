In retrospect, it appears that this property should have been zoned M-1 and possibly grand-fathered
in since it had always had some form of commercial and/or manufacturing use. This was first by the
railroad and then by a private wood yard and by Mr. Moore since his acquisition of the property.
If I may be of further assistance, please advise.

Subj: Petition to Re-Zone Property - B. Moore
Gentlemen:
When zoning was adopted, I, David S. Nash was one of the three Board of Supervisor members. The
property of Mr. Bobby Moore was overlooked. The property should have been zoned M-1. As long
as I can remember that property has been Commercial Property.
If I can be of any further assistance, please advise.
Sincerely,
David S. Nash
