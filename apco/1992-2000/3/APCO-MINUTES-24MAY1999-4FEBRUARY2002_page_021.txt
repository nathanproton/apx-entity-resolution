explained that she did not feel that this was the kind of subdivision that it was anticipated
the road would be paved.
Mr. Bosiger asked why this matter was before the Board instead of the Planning
Commission?
Mrs. Ferguson explained that this was not a matter for the Planning Commission since it
was dealing with the Subdivision Ordinance instead of the Zoning Ordinance.
Mr. Bosiger asked if the issue was the fact that the property to be divided was not on a
State Maintained highway?
Mrs. Ferguson explained that was the issue exactly.
Mr. Carter stated that his understanding of the situation was that the owner subdivided
the property without doing his homework and finding out what the ordinance had to say
about this matter.
Mrs. Seay stated that was correct and that she did not catch the problem.
Mrs. Ferguson explained that the owner had been into the office to see if he could divide
two acres from this parcel and was told that it would not meet the requirements of the
subdivision ordinance.
Mr. Bosiger asked when the owner did this.
Mrs. Ferguson explained that she did not have the dates but it was prior to the owner
dividing the property.
Mr. Carter stated that he understood the dilemma.
Mrs. Seay stated that the other thing that she would like to bring to the Board’s attention
was that she had been told that this property could not be divided into smaller lots
because there was only one other site that would take a septic system. Mrs. Seay said
that she would not be comfortable asking the Board for this exemption if this property
could be divided into smaller lots.
Mr. Bosiger stated that he felt the original intent of the ordinance was to see that lots
were served by State maintained highways.
Mr. Torrence asked if this road was a public right of way?
Mrs. Seay said that she thought it was a public thoroughfare.
Mrs. Ferguson explained that the Board had previously denied a similar request from
another individual.
