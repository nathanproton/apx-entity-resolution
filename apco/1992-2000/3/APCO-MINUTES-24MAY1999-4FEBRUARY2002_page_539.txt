At 6:59 P.M. Mr. Kendrick opened the Public Hearing and made the following statement: This
joint public hearing provides property owners with the opportunity to present their zoning
petitions and give concerned citizens a change to speak in support of or against the petitions that
are before the Appomattox Planning Commission and the Board of Supervisors. Please note that
the Public Hearing is not the appropriate forum to engage in discussion of the petitions. Any
questions or discussion will take place during the Planning Commission meeting following the
Public Hearing. We will begin a hearing of each petition with comments by the petitioner,
followed by comments in support of the petition and finally individuals speaking against the
petition. As you approach the microphone, please state your name and address for the record.
