Ms. Ferguson explained that there has been a change in the notice requirements for
budgets which now has to be advertised 30 days prior to the public hearing on the tax
levy.
Ms. Ferguson stated that the budget schedule would have to change due to this code
change.
Ms. Ferguson explained that the soonest the Board could meet and hold the public
hearing for the tax levy would be April 28, 2008.
Ms. Ferguson stated that she would discuss this in more depth at the budget work session
which is scheduled for Wednesday, March 19".
Mr. Overstreet stated that he did not feel it was appropriate to set your tax rate before you

rate.
Ms. Ferguson stated that we have to knowa tax rate to advertise the budget next week.
