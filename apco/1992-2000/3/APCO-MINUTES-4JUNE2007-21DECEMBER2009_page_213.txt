Mr. Tanner also questioned if there would be fencing and a gate around the tower. Mr.
Hunt stated that there would be a fence and locked gate around the tower.
Chairman Craft called on Mr. Dennis Hunt, President of Guaranteed Network Services,
Inc. to speak.
Mr. Hunt stated that they are building the tower to give broad band to the County of
Appomattox. Mr. Hunt stated that there are two services that come through the Town of
Appomattox, but none in the County.
Mr. Hunt stated that there were two things he was concerned about, one being the height
of the tower due to radio frequency has a tendency to drop so with the more height you
have the more people you can serve. The second concern was trying to keep it out of
sight. Obviously there is no way to build a tower at 190 feet and keep it totally out of
sight. They have tried to plan this so people can live a normal life without an obstruction
of the tower to you. Mr. Hunt also gave reasons for allowing both the towers. The first
reason would be to benefit the small businesses and home based businesses, second
families need these services for children in school and college. He also stated that it
would add another access for 911.
Chairman Craft called for any questions from the Board. Being no further questions from
