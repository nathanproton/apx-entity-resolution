Mr. Moore called the meeting to order at 6:00 p.m, stating that this was a recessed meeting from
April 8, 2000 held in the Appomattox Courthouse.
Handouts were provided by Dr. Krug regarding school assessments and needs.
Mr. Kendrick reviewed some of the concerns discussed at the April 8"" meeting. Mr. Kendrick stated
that the Tax Rate had been advertized at .80 cents but the actual tax rate increase will depend on how
much help we can get from you. Mr. Kendrick also stated he did not want to loose good, competent
teachers because of salaries.
Lengthy discussion on salaries.
Mr. Perrow explained how the calculations were figured based on number of students and the rate
set by the State. There is no option on SOQ funding, the law says you must meet this fund.
The State does not get involved in Capital Projects such as building, with the exception being the
Lottery School Construction Grant..
