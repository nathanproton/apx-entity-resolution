Mr. Bosiger called the public hearing to order at 7:00 P.M. explained the purpose of the
hearing was to receive public comment on several zoning petitions and gave the
procedure for addressing comments to the Board.
Mr. Bosiger then asked Mr. Caldwell, Clerk to the Planning Commission, to read the first
petition.
Mr. Caldwell read petition number 99-391 of June B. Chenault for a variance to side yard
setback required by Appomattox Town Zoning. Property is located at intersection of
High Street and Bandana Street.
Mr. Bosiger called for comments on this petition.
Mrs. June B. Chenault came forward and gave her address as Appomattox, Virginia.
Mrs. Chenault explained that her reason for this request was so that she could add a
bedroom and bath.
Mr. Bosiger called for other comments.
Mr. Steve Conner came forward and gave his address as Second Street, Appomattox.
Virginia. Mr. Conner continued that a little over a year ago Mrs. Chenault made the
statement that she did not want anyone to have variances in this neighborhood that it
should be left like it is. Mr. Conner continued that he felt she had enough yard to do
what she wanted but she would have to rearrange it differently.
