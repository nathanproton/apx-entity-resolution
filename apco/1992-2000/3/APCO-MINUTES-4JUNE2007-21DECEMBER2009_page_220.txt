tonight and at the next meeting come back with a new budget figure. At that time the
Board will need to establish the proposed tax rate so that it can be advertised in the paper
and we can stay on schedule.
Mr. Craft questioned if once the tax rate is set and advertised can they raise it. Ms.
Ferguson explained to the Board that once this rate is advertised you can lower the rate
but you cannot raise the rate.
Mr. Tanner stated that after the budget is complete he would like the Board to revisit the
land use tax. Mr. Tanner stated that there are things that can be done and working closely
with the new Commissioner we should be able to help the farmers and not overburden the
County. Mr. Tanner stated that he would like to see the Board still promote land
conservation also.
Mr. Tanner made a motion to adjourn the budget work session and Mr. Conrad seconded
the motion. Vote: Mr. Carter, aye; Mr. Conrad, aye; Mr. Craft, aye; Mr. Moore, aye; Mr.
Tanner, aye.
Chairman Craft closed the budget session at 8:50 p.m.
