Petition #04-535 of BFI Transfer Systems of Virginia, LLC and Clayton C. Bryant:
Rezone 12.15 acres located on Route 460 between Route 609 and Route 608 from
Commercial District B-1 to Industrial District M-1. Also request a Conditional Use
Permit to operate a solid waste transfer station at this location. Property is identified as
Tax Map 60-(8)12.
The Planning Commission recommends approval of this petition with the conditions as
proffered by the applicant.
Mr. Conrad questioned item 15 of the proffer: “The facility shall be limited to accepting 1,000
tons per day, based on a thirty-day average”. How many trucks would that be coming in and out
of the County during the day hauling trash?
They do not anticipate reaching the 1,000 tons per day capacity in the near future. Initially there
will be approximately 20-24 tractor-trailers hauling 300 tons per day.
Mr. Conrad also questioned how far off the road BFI was responsible for cleaning up, should
trash blow/fall off the trucks.
The proffer requires them to pick up trash on both side of Route 460 on all sections of the road
either adjacent to or within 100 yards of the Transfer Station boundary. Also, with permission
from adjoining property owners, they are required to remove any wind blown debris originating
from the transfer station. They will also have a 24 hour telephone number for the reporting of
these instances.
Mr. Armbrust had a question regarding Item 8 of the proffer pertaining to the convenience center
adjoining the Transfer Station.
The response was the land will be available for this center. BFI at one point was going to provide
this, but later decided it would be providing a service without an RFP or procurement procedure.
They will however, provide this area, pave and fence it in. The County can at a later date decide if
they will man this site.
Ms. Ferguson asked for clarification on the question of whether or not private citizens would be
allowed to dispose of waste at this facility.
