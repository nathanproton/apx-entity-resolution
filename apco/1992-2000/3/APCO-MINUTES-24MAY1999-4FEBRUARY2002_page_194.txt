Mr. Moore called the public hearing to order and explained the procedure for addressing
comments to the Board.
Mr. Moore then asked Mr. Caldwell, Clerk to the Planning Commission to read the first petition.
Mr. Caldwell read petition number 99-406 of Fred H. Jones to rezone property from A-1 to B-1
with a conditional use for warehouses. Property is Tax Map Parcel 64-A-95, 97, & 98 and is
located on Route 24 between Route 656 and by-pass.
Mr. Moore called for comments on this petition.
Mr. Fred Jones came forward and gave his address as P. O. Box 818, Appomattox, Virginia. Mr.
Moore continued that he owned twenty-five acres at this location and that Thomasville wanted
him to build them more warehouse space that was needed right now.
Mr. Moore called for other comments on this petition.
