Brandon Stidham - County Planner
At 7:02 P.M. Mr. Kendrick opened the Public Hearing and stated to those in attendance that the
Public Hearing is not the appropriate forum to engage in discussion on the petitions. Discussion will
take place during the Planning Commission meeting that will immediately follow the public meeting
in the Jury Room off to the right. We will begin a hearing of each petition with comments by the
petitioner, followed by comments from individuals to speak for the petition and finally by
individuals wishing to speak against the petition. As you approach the microphone, please state your
name, address and whether you are for or against the petition.
