Dear Sirs:
This letter is written in support of Mr. Bobby Moore’s petition for rezoning a parcel of land in
Concord, Va. In my opinion, the original zoning designation for this property as agricultural was
incorrect and should now be rectified.
For over 50 years, this property has been the site of various commercial ventures. As a child, I
remember going with my grandfather, Mr. Oscar Jamerson, to the wood yard located on this site
where he purchased wood. Also during this period, Norfolk and Western served the railroad siding
from which products were shipped by rail from the wood yard. In fact, the old rail bed and siding
are still evident today. Beginning in the early 1960's , our trucking company hauled wood from
Eddie Gunter’s wood yard which operated on this site.
An analysis of the previous uses of this property will indicate long standing commercial use of this
site - not agricultural use as indicated by the zoning designation. I urge you to give proper and careful
consideration to Mr. Moore’s petition.
Sincerely,
G,.H. Jamerson, Jr.
President, Jamerson Bros. Trucking Co. Inc.

Re: Re-zoning Petition - 00-424, Appomattox Cty.
Dear Ms. Ferguson,
I wish, as a property owner in Appomattox County, to go on record as stating my objections to the
above referenced petition, which seeks to change zoning of property from A-1 to M-1 with
conditions to allow industrial activity. Again, I object to this zone change.
