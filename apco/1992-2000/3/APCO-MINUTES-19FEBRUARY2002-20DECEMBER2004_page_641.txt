Dear Mr. Spencer:
As I communicated in our conversation on Tuesday, September 14, 2004, Gleaning For The
World, Inc. has been in discussion with representatives from BFI Transfer Systems of Virginia for
two (2) years regarding the use of the 12.15 acres in Appomattox County. WE have also
discussed the sell and use of the land with Clayton C. Bryant. WE are satisfied that BFI will be a
good neighbor and good for the county. I realize that the disposal industry is closely regulated,
therefore, discharging any fears of damage to streams and the soil. The transfer station is not a
landfill but a location where disposable waste can be collected, bailed and transferred to
