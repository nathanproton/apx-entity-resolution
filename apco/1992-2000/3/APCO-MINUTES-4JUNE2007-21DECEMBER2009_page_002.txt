Mr. Roark stated the Planning Commission has also recommended some changes be
made to the Appomattox County Subdivision Ordinance.
Mr. Carter stated that we need to keep in mind that one of these ordinance
amendments was initiated for a purpose and we need to look at this change as a global
effect on the county for the future and this is something we need to consider very hard
and very deep.
