Chairman Craft explained the next item for discussion would be Administrative Item #2
Property and Liability Insurance Coverage. Chairman Craft explained that a decision
needed to be made tonight.
Ms. Ferguson explained that Mr. Conrad had spoken with her earlier today and had some
questions concerning the self insured program with VACo. Ms. Ferguson stated that we
can take more time in getting this information since we currently have a temporary rider
policy with Cabell in effect until a decision is made. There will be no loss of coverage
while we are getting this information.
Mr. Conrad stated that we have been covered by Cabell for years now and they have been
more than adequate to take care of any situation that has occurs. Mr. Conrad states that
there are counties that are with the self insured program; however he does have some
questions and would like them answered before the Board makes a decision. Mr. Conrad
would like to see the County go the cheapest route as possible but at the same time that if
we are in a situation there will be no surprises. Mr. Conrad stated that if Ms. Ferguson
could take a couple more weeks and research this it will give the Board the knowledge to
make a good prudent decision.
Ms. Ferguson stated that Ms. Heizleman has been working with the County on this
program and providing us with needed information and feels confident that she will be
able to give her some contacts.
Mr. Conrad instructed Ms. Ferguson to go forward and discuss this with the different
localities and provide information to the Board at the next meeting.
Chairman Craft stated that it would be the census of the Board to postpone this item until
next board meeting.
