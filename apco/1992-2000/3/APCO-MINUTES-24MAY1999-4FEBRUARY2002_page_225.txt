Mr. Pickett opened the meeting and turned it over to Mr. Bob Moje.
Mr. Moje presented a project schedule and information on the average construction cost of
elementary schools in the State.
Discussion followed as to the cost per square foot for schools in our area instead of looking at the
State average.
Questions were then asked concerning the architectural fees for the new school and how they
were figured.
Mr. Moje explained that they had presented the School Board with a flat fee for their services
based on the number of students that the school would house. Mr. Moje continued that their fee
did not fluctuate with the cost of the project only with the size school, 600 or 800 student, that
the County decided to build.
The school design was next discussed as to whether the architect would look at a two story
structure as opposed to a one story.
