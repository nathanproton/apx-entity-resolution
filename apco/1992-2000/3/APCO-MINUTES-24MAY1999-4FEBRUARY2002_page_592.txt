Mr. Mahon closed by stating they will submit clarifications on definitions in writing.
Mr. Stidham next called Mr. David Smith with NutriBlend.
Mr. Smith came forward and stated he was an employee of NutriBlend, another biosolid contractor.
Mr. Smith stated he also had some concerns regarding this Ordinance as written.
95.7 - Notification signage required:
Agrees with Synagro regarding the location of signage. Also feels a contact person to hear
citizen concerns should be a County representative as opposed to VDH, because VDH is so
very hard to reach.
95.8 Liability:
The statement “cost arising from activities” is too vague.
95.9 Training requirements:
Mr. Smith agrees with Synagro that the Contractors have a program in place already.
Mr. Smith closed by stating he would like to have a longer time period to review this ordinance.
Mr. Kendrick asked if there were any more comments.
Mrs. Ida Doss stated if there is no health concern, and biosolids are so safe, why does the EPA and
the VDH have to keep such a close check on the use of this product.
Mr. Kendrick called for additional comments.
Hearing no further comments, at 7:41 P.M. Mr. Kendrick declared the public hearing closed.
