He questioned Mr. Carroll regarding the repairs to the plaster wall in the Courtroom. He had
confronted Mr. Lovelace, who was doing this repair, as to who had authorized him to do this work.

being done in light of the controversy on the Courthouse Renovation Project?

article that appeared in the Lynchburg newspaper on Monday and also the Appomattox paper
