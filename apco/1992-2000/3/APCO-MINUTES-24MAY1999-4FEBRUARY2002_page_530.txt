Carroll stated he felt it would be best to follow some outline rather than skipping around.
Mr. Carroll stated that the budget has a short fall of $254,876.
Mr. Carroll suggested they start with the School Budget since it was the most complex and was mostlikely of the most concern to the Board members.
1) School Budget:
I. School Budget - Chapter 1073:
The budget submitted by the School Board was based on the Governor’s proposed amendments, butsince the General Assembly adjourned , there will not be any changes to the State Budget.The funding level for the school will probably be Chapter 1073. We had discussed these alternates(#2 & #3) previously, basing our figures on the Average Daily Membership (ADM). By using theADM of 2346, we will have a decrease in local funds of approximately $84,000. Using the Stateprojected ADM of 2328 there will be a decrease of $112,000. The decision is at what ADM leveldoes the Board want to fund?
After some discussion, the Board decided to fund the School Budget based on Chapter 1073, ADM2346, Alternate #2.
Il. School Budget - Incentive Based Programs:
There are still some things with the Elementary School Project that will effect this item. The ADMlevel will also have an effect on this funding. Based on Chapter 1073 with a ADM of 2346, the Statewill fund $1,350,000 for incentive based programs if the Board provides a local match of $480,000.
After some discussion, the Board decided to fully fund the Incentive Based Programs.
The Board also gave Mr. Carroll permission to sign all documents related to the Incentive BasedPrograms.
II. Budget and AES Project:
Furniture/Equipment: The school has included $135,000 from the remainder of the Special ProjectFund and the CIP account to be used for purchasing furnishings for the AES project. This amountis over and above the required funding and does not gain additional matching funds.
There were no changes to this figure.
Total funding for School Budget - $15,222,581.
IV. Budget Categorization:
Mr. Kendrick asked Mr. Carroll to discuss this item. Mr. Carroll began by stating that in the pastthe Board has approved the budget as a whole and separating out the School food fund. What theBoard can do is separate out the Budget into seven (7) categories: instruction, maintenance, etc., thatthe School Board breaks their budget down into. Ifthe Board approves the Budget in this way, theSchool Board can rotate these funds within each category, but they cannot transfer from one category
