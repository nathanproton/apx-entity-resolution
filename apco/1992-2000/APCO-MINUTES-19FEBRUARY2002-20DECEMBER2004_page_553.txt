14. Continue work on the FY2005 Budget:
Mrs. Ferguson stated they had stopped the previous discussion on page 30 —
Dept. 3202 - Volunteer Fire Department - There was an addition to the Pamplin
Fire Department, line 5605 - This is the Fire Program money that is divided
equally between Pamplin and Appomattox. The normal contribution is
$2,000.00. There was also some discussion about a new pumper or tanker. Mrs.
Ferguson has suggested they seek financing for this new truck. In the past, the
Board has allotted funds over a five year period to help pay for equipment.
3501 — Animal Control: There was some discussion regarding the improvements
that need to be made to the animal pound facility. Mr. Martin has visited some
of the surrounding areas that have new facilities to see what others have done.
The basic construction costs for a facility is approximately $125,000. This gives
us an idea of what we are facing in the near future towards improving the animal
pound facility. It has been recommended that we raise the Dog License Fees to
help offset some of the expenses incurred.
3606 - E911: Need to develop a job description and advertisement for 911
Coordinator. We will need to add to this budget approximately ten (10) new
positions for dispatchers to handle 24 hours shifts - 7 days a week. We have
not tied down those salaries. All of these should be covered by the funds that
are raised via the telephone tax fees.
