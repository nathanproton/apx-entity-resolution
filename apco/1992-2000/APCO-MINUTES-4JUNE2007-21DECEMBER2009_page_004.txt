Mr. Roark then read the next ordinance revision. This was originally requested as an
additional permanent use to the B-1 Commercial District. The Planning Commission felt
that each circumstance was unique and felt it would be better to add this category as a
Conditional Use. In this way, each request could be considered on its own merit.
