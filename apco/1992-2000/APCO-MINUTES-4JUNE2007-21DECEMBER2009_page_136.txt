Mr. Carter would like to see the Town look at the water line again. We need to move
ahead together.
Mr. Garrett had talked about the possibility of having a Preliminary Engineering Report
done to give the Town Council some idea of what direction to take.
Mr. Conrad feels that the Preliminary Engineering report is a good idea and it would
answer some of the questions the Council members presently have.
