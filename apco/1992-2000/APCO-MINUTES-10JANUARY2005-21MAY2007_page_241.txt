Route 608 — Stonewall Road: There has been some planning to re-build Route 608 from
Oakville to Route 460. This was listed as a major need for the County. The design and
engineering on this project is ready to begin. The question is are there other areas that
need to be addressed or is this the major concern in the County. This project will take
the County’s money for basically the next five (5) years. This is not the entire road, just
a portion (from Rt. 669 to Rt. 670).
Discussion centered around tabling Route 608 and maybe adding Route 613 and/or
Route 604. There is a lot of construction in the area of Route 613 at the present time.
Improvements on Route 604 would run from Route 727 to C & E Grocery and on Route
613 would run from Route 460 to around the Appomattox Community Park road.
Mr. Austin explained that the improvements on Route 613 would cost approximately
$800,000 to $900,000 and would include widening by about 18”.
Route 659 will be paved this year and this would be a cut across from Route 613 to
Route 26.
Mr. Armbrust stated that the improvement of Route 613 would be an important factor in
drawing special events to the Community Park in the future.
The Board, by consensus, made the decision to pull Route 608 from the Six Year Plan
and replace with Route 613 from Route 460 to the entrance to the Community Park and
Route 604 from Route 727 to C & E Grocery. This would include a change at the
intersection of Route 727 and Route 604 to improve visibility.
Mr. Austin reminded the Board of the Sidewalk Project requested by the Town for
connecting the schools. They also plan to run the sidewalk up Ferguson Street to Court
Street. The costs are increasing and they have been told there is no additional money
for these projects. If this runs short of funds, would the Board want to funds this from
Secondary monies. They have received some good bids for this project.
There was some discussion regarding a possible turning lane at Ferguson and Court
Streets providing the right-of-way can be obtained.
The Board, by consensus, agreed to fund any sidewalk project shortage with money
from Secondary Roads.
Mr. Austin also provided everyone with containing data on the unpaved roads in the
County. He also reminded everyone of the Public Hearing on the Six-Year Plan
scheduled for December 19, 2005 at 6:00 p.m.
At 6:42 p.m. Mr. Carter adjourned the work session.
