Gentlemen:
This is to advise you that we are opposed to the granting of a
Conditional Use Permit for home occupation (Sporting Goods Sales),
including the sale of firearms, at the residence on lot 15 Cedar Knolls
Subdivision.
My home is right across the road from this residence occupied by Mr.
Charles Griffin.
My husband James House is on a respirator and I recently suffered a
stroke that requires 24 hour, 7 day a week professional care.
Therefore, we are unable to attend your meeting on May 20, 1996 at 7:00
p.m.
Please accept this note confirming our objection to this permit.
Witnessed by:
Betty A. Powell Meinu T. House
Nurses Aide
