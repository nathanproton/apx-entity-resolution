There are a lot of new requests that you have never funded. Total amount around $94,160 in new
requests.
Discussion on the above as to what could be funded and what has to be cut.
Mr. Kendrick stated he felt the Pamplin Fire Department request was a fair request because they
intended to use the old building for a community center until the R. R. Station was renovated, and
the old building would also be used as an emergency center.
More discussion on the issue of tax rate lagging behind and the debt service rising.
Mr. Carter spoke in favor of keeping the donations as they have been and not increasing any or taking
on any new ones. Mr. Moore agreed.
Mr. Kendrick requested we fund the $15,000 for Pamplin Fire Department.
Mr. Hancock stated he felt if we cut one new request, we cut them all. If you reduce some, reduce
them all.
Mr. Hancock suggested that the Lighthouse of Love request be cut in half from $50,000 to $25,000.
Decision was to take all new requests out and will address this later.
