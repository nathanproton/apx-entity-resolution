calling him regarding this.
We presently have a Lease Law in effect for about a one month period during the
months of April and May. Dogs must be under owner control or restricted to their
property. If anyone has a complaint, call the E-911 center and one of the animal
wardens will respond.
Mr. Moore said he received a call about a week ago from a lady who lives on the road
going from Liberty Chapel Church back to Vera. She is complaining about a person who
has a lot of mess, junk and animals and the place looks like an open dump.
Ms. Ferguson stated that the Board needs to approve last month's bills for payment as
they were not presented at the last meeting.

presented. ROLL CALL VOTE: Mr. Armbrust, aye; Mr. Conrad, aye; Mr. Craft, aye; Mr.
