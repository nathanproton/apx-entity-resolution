Mr. Carter called the meeting to order at 6:30 p.m. and asked Mr. Hancock to give the invocation.
Mr. Carter then called Mr. Milton Thacker, VDOT Assistant Resident Engineer to address the Board
regarding the VDOT Six Year Plan for Secondary Roads, the Porter House Road Resolution and the
Appointment of Road Viewers.
Mr. Thacker began by discussing the Secondary Road Six Year Plan Resolution which he hopes the
Board will adopt. He stated that there had been a reduction in the funds and the only plan he was
aware of that was dropped was Route 659 in the unpaved roads. The other projects, Route 641 and
652 , the significant change was the dates to move them out. Hopefully, more funds will become
available in the fall.
VDOT is asking for a resolution for Porter House Road to be put in the rural additions.
The Board also needs to appoint Road Viewers for the month of July so VDOT can proceed with the
Brandenwood project.
Mr. Thacker asked if there were any questions or comments.
Mr. Carter asked if there was any discussion regarding either the Porter House Road or the
Secondary SixYear Plan Resolutions before considering a vote on these items.
Mr. Carter then called for a motion to adopt the Porter House Road Resolution.
