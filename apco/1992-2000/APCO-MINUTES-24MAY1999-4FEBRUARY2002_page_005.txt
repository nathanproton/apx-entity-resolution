Ms. Lindsay explained that the railroad has begun work on the Main Street crossing and
she is unsure of their date for completion.
Mr. Bosiger asked if any Supervisor had concerns for Ms. Lindsay.
Mr. Carwile began by referencing the drainage ditch next to Carver Price Elementary
School. Mr. Carwile asked if what he was observing was a result of his request
concerning the dangers with the ditch.
Ms. Lindsay explained that she was unaware of any work being done in this area but she
would check on this and get back with Mr. Carwile.
Mr. Torrence explained to Ms. Lindsay that he was concerned with the fact that F1021
was unpaved.
Ms. Lindsay explained that F1021 was never designed to be surfaced. Ms. Lindsay
explained that it was designed to be a gravel surface road back to those houses.
Mr. Torrence continued that all the other access roads that were constructed during the
bypass construction were surfaced.
Ms. Lindsay explained that F1021 was not the only access road that was gravel.
Ms. Lindsay then explained the process for getting this access road surfaced.
Mr. Torrence asked if a guardrail could be installed at the end of this road due to a steep
drop off.
Mr. Carter asked if the improvements to Route 641 included widening?
Ms. Lindsay stated that there would be very little widening to Route 641.
Mr. Bosiger asked if anyone had other concerns for Ms. Lindsay?
Hearing none, Mr. Bosiger thanked and excused Ms. Lindsay.
