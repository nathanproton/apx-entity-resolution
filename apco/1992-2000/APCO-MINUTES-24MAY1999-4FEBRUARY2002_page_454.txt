Mr. Lee had one management comment to bring out. Beginning in FY 2003 the Governmental
Accounting Standards Board has issued a new statement requiring the County to depreciate fixed
assets in governmental funds. This will include landfill movable equipment, sheriffs vehicles,
school buses, buildings, and that sort of items, not necessarily fixtures and furniture. A threshold
level will have to be established, generally around $5,000.
Mr. Lee answered some questions that various Board Members had regarding the Audit.
At 6:50 Mr. Kendrick recessed the meeting until after the Public Hearing on the proposed Enhanced
911 Road Naming Ordinance.
