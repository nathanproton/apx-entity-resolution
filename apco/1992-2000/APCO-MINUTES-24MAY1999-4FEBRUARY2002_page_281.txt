There was a lengthy discussion on the budget expenditures and tax rate.
Mr. Carwile stated we are looking at a budget with roughly a $2,000,000 shortfall.. We need to be
real with ourselves and the people. The school budget is the only place we really have to make any
changes.
Mrs. Ferguson stated she had transferred the $700,000 into the Revenue from the IDA.
The $300,000 for the Sheriffs Department was also put in there. That is where the major adjustment
comes in.
