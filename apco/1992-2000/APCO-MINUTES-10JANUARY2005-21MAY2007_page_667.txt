At 6:15 p.m. Mr. Carter opened the Public Hearing and stated the purpose of this public
hearing is to discuss the Proposed Amendments to the Appomattox County Code —
Subdivision Ordinance: Section 1.4 Definitions; Section 3.4 Exemptions; Section 3.8
Family Division; Section 6.11 Cul de Sacs and Section 170-47 Conditional Uses in B-1
Zoning District in the Zoning Ordinance.
Mr. Roark read the following code amendments:
PROPOSED AMENDMENT - SUBDIVISION ORDINANCE
SECTION: 1.4 Definitions, Agricultural Subdivision
ORIGIN OF REQUEST: Board of Supervisors. Issue arose with the Knight case of
minimum lot size for exempt lots (agricultural subdivisions). Research of the
surrounding counties found that only Bedford County allows exemptions such as this
and their minimum lot size is 20 acres. The Board of Supervisors requested in April that
staff move forward with this amendment.
