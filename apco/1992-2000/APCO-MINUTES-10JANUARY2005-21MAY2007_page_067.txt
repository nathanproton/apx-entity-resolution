Mr. Craft stated he has had several contacts from people in Pamplin/Hixburg area about
coyotes. They are asking if we are going to put a bounty on them. Some counties
already do. He feels if this becomes a bigger problem, we may have to look into ways
of dealing with these animals.
Also the “Rails to Trails” was to run from Pamplin to Burkeville. He now understands
this will end approximately one mile from Pamplin and one mile from Burkeville. If this
is true, Pamplin will not benefit from this. He would like for the Board to write a letter
to the railroad and express our desire to have the “Rails to Trails” end in the Town of
Pamplin.
Ms. Ferguson will check with Mr. Watkins Abbitt regarding this issue.
Mr. Carter stated he would like to express his appreciation to Ms. Ferguson and those
who put together the Priority List for the County for the year 2005.
