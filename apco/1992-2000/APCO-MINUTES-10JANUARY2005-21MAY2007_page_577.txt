Mr. Overstreet answered that this was his opinion. He hopes that the attorney
who is examining the title for the person now purchasing this property will agree
with him. There is a theory of real estate law that if you overcome a defect
somewhere along the line, then everything else that goes after that stays as it
was. So if you cure this defect, it should cure all conveyances thereafter.
Mr. Armbrust was questioning this because this property is located in his district.
Mr. Overstreet has been in contact with the attorney handling this real estate
transaction and informed him of what is presently being done to cure this defect.
Mr. Carter called for further comments.
Hearing none, at 6:10 p.m. Mr. Carter closed this public hearing.
