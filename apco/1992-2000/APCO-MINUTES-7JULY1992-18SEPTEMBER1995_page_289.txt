Virginia’s local governments are subject to 391 Federal and state
mandates; and
WHEREAS, unfunded mandates on local governments have increased
significantly in recent years; and
WHEREAS, federal and state mandates require cities, counties and towns
to perform duties without consideration of local circumstances or
capacity; and
WHEREAS, in some cases mandates require local governments to redirect
their priorities, to meet federal and state objectives rather than
community objectives; and
WHEREAS, excessive federal and state regulations on local governments
impose harsh pressures on local budgets, often requiring increases
in local taxes and fees, and/or reduced local services for
residents; and
WHEREAS, federal and state mandates too often are inflexible,
one-size-fits-all requirements that impose unrealistic time frames
and specify procedures or facilities where less costly
alternatives might be just as effective; and
WHEREAS, existing mandates impose harsh pressures on local budgets,
often requiring increases in local taxes; and
WHEREAS, the cumulative impact of these legislative and regulatory
actions directly affect the citizens of our cities, counties
and towns; and
WHEREAS, the Virginia Municipal League, the Virginia Association of
Counties and the Virginia School Boards Association are working
with localities, school boards and organizations across the nation
to begin a public education compaign to help citizens understand
and then reduce the burden and inflexibility of unfunded mandates,
beginning with a National Unfunded Mandates Day on October 27,
1993;
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT the County of Appomattox, endorses
the efforts of the Virginia Municipal League, the Virginia
Association of Counties and the Virginia School Boards Association
and their national counterparts, and supports working with the
national groups to fully inform our citizens about the impact of
federal and state mandates on our governments and the pocketbooks
of our citizens;
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED THAT the County of Appomattox plans to redouble
efforts to inform members of our Congressional and General
Assembly delegations about the impact of federal and state
mandates and plans to work with the delegations to reduce the
burden of unfunded mandates on our citizens.
