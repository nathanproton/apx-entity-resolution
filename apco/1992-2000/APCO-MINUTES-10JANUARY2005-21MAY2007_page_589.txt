2. Emmitt Knight’s Request for a Waiver to the Subdivision Ordinance:
Mr. Knight is requesting a waiver to the subdivision ordinance minimum lot size
requirement. Tax Map #97-1-2C located off Route 604 (Promise Land Road).
Mr. Conrad stated that he can see what there is as far as the ordinance goes. He can
also see Mr. Knight’s point. However, is he is troubled from the standpoint that it looks
like there are other alternatives present and his concern is if we waive the ordinance in
this instance we are opening a door saying that this can be done at anytime.
Mr. Craft agrees that there are other options available to Mr. Knight, and he is not in
favor of granting this waiver.
Mr. Conrad made a motion, seconded by Mr. Craft, to deny the Request from Emmitt
Knight for a waiver to the subdivision ordinance minimum lot size requirement. VOTE:
Mr. Armbrust, aye; Mr. Conrad, aye; Mr. Craft, aye; Mr. Moore, aye; and Mr. Carter, aye.
