Mr. Carter then called for SUPERVISOR CONCERNS:
Mr. Armbrust stated he had a concern regarding Land Use Assessment.
Mr. Overstreet stated that before we can discuss the Land Use we need to go over the
Declaration. He then read the declaration from the Conflict of Interest section of the
Cove of Virginia, because Mr. Moore and Mr. Armbrust, both own land which may be
eligible for Land Use Taxation. Section 2.2-3112.A.2 and 2.2-3115 G — Code of Virginia:
“I hereby declare that I have a personal interest in the transaction of adopting Land Use
Taxation in Appomattox County by virtue of my ownership of real estate in the County
which may be eligible for Land Use. Therefore, I am a member of a group that may be
affected by this transaction.”
“I declare that notwithstanding the above, I am able to participate in this transaction
fairly, objectively and in the public interest.”
Mr. Moore and Mr. Armbrust acknowledged this declaration.
Mr. Armbrust: His concerns on bringing up the Land Use Assessment is that a lot of
his constituents have called him and he has listened to them. When the motion came
up the other night he held his vote because we have looked at it as a lot of unknowns.
