440
Despite this, a more expensive (26.4 million) pipeline source, more than 20 miles WEST,
in Lynchburg, was chosen WHY? Study of Table I (Water Demand Projections) showed
that most of the water was allocated to industrial, commercial and residential growth
along 460 west,
There can be do doubt that the Goal was always "DEVELOPMENT OF 460 WEST’!
The details of that plan had nothing to offer Town citizens except James River water at
a higher price. County citizens would not and will not be able to use the PIPELINE
unless their property borders 460 west!
Who would/will benefit? Only Landowners and Builders in a narrow strip along 460
WEST would benefit. EXCEPT DURING DROUGHTS, Lynchburg has water to sell and
wants to develop industry within and near the city.
ALL COUNTY TAXPAYERS were/are slated to pay the cost of the PIPELINE! Users
would pay both Taxes and User Fees.
Citizens began to and are, still asking questions and raising objections to paying for
something they didn’t need or couldn’t use.
Region 2000 was hired to produce a "POLITICALLY” acceptable plan to pipe Lynchburg
to Appomattox.
Their first effort reduced the cost of a pipeline by $10.9 million to $5.5 million.
Still a pipeline, still Lynchburg water, still too expensive...back to the drawing boards.
Finally, a new study, and a FINAL (?) DRAFT that presents three (3) absurdly
alternatives and three(3) pipeline versions complicated by a new feature called a PUBLIC
SERVICE AUTHORITY that creates another government organization similar to the
"WILDLY UN-SUCCESSFUL” IDA (INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY)! Only one
(1) business located there!
One source of water for a new pipeline from Campbell County is the Otter River. First
citizens feared the POLLUTION of the James River; now they need to fear the
POLLUTION of the Otter River which has 14 users, including the Bedford Sewer and
Water plants, as well as the Gunoe Sausage Factory.
I’ve "done the math” to paraphrase Mr. Gillespie and it doesn’t look appealing to Town
Citizens who will pay a minimum of 36.9% more for water than they do now. Any
pipeline option makes the Town and the County DEPENDENT WHILE IGNORING THE
VALUE OF OUR OWN WATER!
The RATIONALE seems to be: "that Mayor Spiggle wants out of the Water Business” and
Supervisor Carter “want to do SOMETHING”!
