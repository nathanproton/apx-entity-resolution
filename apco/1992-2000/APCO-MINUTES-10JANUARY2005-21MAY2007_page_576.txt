Mr. Carter then asked if there was anyone present who wished to speak in
regards to this ratification.
The question was asked as to the location of this property.
Mr. Overstreet stated it was located near the Industrial Park. (Route 1064 off

Mr. Armbrust stated that he knew this property technically went through the
proper channels. Is this action in line with that process?
