This matter has been on the table for several months and action is needed to
finalize the matter.
Mr. Craft stated that when this item was presented previously, he asked that it be tabled
in order for the Youth Sports members to explain why this was necessary. The night
this was scheduled, no one showed up from this organization. It is his understanding
that this trailer is used mainly for the storage of equipment.
Mr. Craft made a motion, seconded by Mr. Conrad, to deny the Youth Sports to run an
electric line and install a light in the storage trailer located at the Town Ball Park. VOTE:
Mr. Armbrust, aye; Mr. Conrad, aye; Mr. Craft, aye; Mr. Moore, aye; and Mr. Carter, aye.
(5 aye votes)
5. New Voting Machines: The new voting machines have been purchased and
Ms. Smith has been trained on the usage of these machines. She has offered to
set up a training session for Board Members and County employees for the week
of July 18, 2005. Is there a day of the week that is more convenient for you.
Question was raised if this would be done as a group. It was the Consensus of the
Board to hold this training on Tuesday, July 19, 2005 at 3:30 p.m. at the Old J &D
Courtroom.
