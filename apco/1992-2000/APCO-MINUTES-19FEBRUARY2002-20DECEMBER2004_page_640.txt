Mr. Spencer asked if there was anyone present to speak for this petition.

construction. The property contained about 29.95 acres, primarily wooded.

Dear Mr. Spencer:
Due to my recent surgery, neither my wife nor I will be able to attend the Joint Public Hearing on
September 20, 2004 concerning the request by Betty S. Krantz for a Conditional Use Permit to
allow the operation of a boarding kennel on Route 667, Tax Map #61(A)3. My wife and I are
opposed to such a permit. We do not believe that a boarding kennel should be located in an
agricultural district. We purchased our property for the peace and serenity of a rural area,
without the aggravation of 25 dogs barking and disturbing the peace. And we're concerned that
kennel of this size may reduce the salability and value of our property.
We respectfully request that the commission deny this request.
Sincerely,
Signed: William D. Royal
