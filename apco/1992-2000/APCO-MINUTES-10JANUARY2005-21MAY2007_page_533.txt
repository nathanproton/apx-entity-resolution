$3.50 per one hundred dollar value to $4.60 per one hundred dollar value as this
was not specifically stated in the Public Hearing for the FY2007 Budget.
Mr. Carter stated that there were two (2) businessmen who expressed dismay about this
increase stating it was too much but the Board felt that this was justified and 31%
increase in thirty (30) years was not that much.
Mr. Moore stated he, too, felt this was a terrible increase over what we have had in the
past. If we had been increasing this gradually over the past years, it wouldn’t be so
bad. He can understand why some businessmen would be concerned.
Mr. Conrad also expressed some concerns about the present budget being contingent
upon the increase on the Machinery & Tool Tax. If we did not have this increase would
we not be able to meet our budget requirements.
Ms. Ferguson stated we adopted the FY2007 Budget with the understanding that the
Machinery & Tool Tax would be increased from $3.50 to $4.60 per one hundred dollars
value.
Mr. Conrad made a motion, seconded by Mr. Craft, to re-affirm and establish the
Machinery and Tool Tax Rate for the calendar year 2006 at a rate of $4.60 per one
hundred dollar of value. ROLL CALL VOTE: Mr. Armbrust, aye; Mr. Conrad, aye; Mr.
