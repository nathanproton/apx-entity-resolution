Mr. Moore stated they had a meeting of the committee today and this is not a part of the
architecture whatsoever. This would involve a change order with the contractor. This
would not be handled through the architect.
After some lengthy discussion, the Board by consensus tabled this until the Courthouse is
built.

completion of the FY2004 budget by April 21, 2003.
