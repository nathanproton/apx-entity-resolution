Mr. Kendrick stated here is the situation. It stems back to what Mr. Moore said. You are
saying that the structure we have in place does not allow for us to get the results we want
for tourism. Which means, we need to address that. Do you understand what I am
saying? The employees of the country deserve — each one of them deserves the right - to
be managed and supervised by the same type of authority. If we have an issue where we
feel strongly that we have to make a separate situation for this particular position, then we
need to address why we feel that way. What is it that we feel that we have to do?
Because the organization is not the issue. You have to address the issue — then the issue
should be discussed in a closed session.
Mr. Kendrick continued by saying, leave the structure as it is — set the pay grade and set
the title of the job. That is what my motion was for — this is the job title and this is the
pay grade. Leave the structure where it is and then address it later.
Mr. Carter stated that a motion had been made and seconded that the new position be
