Mr. Gaulden stated that he is trying to keep his father in law’s farm going since his illness and they would

their farm due to a death, fortunately the farm was subdivided and very nice homes were built. He is
afraid that if this was to happen to his family it may not be the same result for his neighbors. Mr. Gaulden
