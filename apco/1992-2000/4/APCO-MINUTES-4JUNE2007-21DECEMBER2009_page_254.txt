amount that she would be comfortable taking from the reserves. Ms. Ferguson stated that
was also without the additional $120,000 funds being reduced by the State.
Ms. Ferguson explained that at .49 cent per 100 which is the tax rate that was advertised,
there would be money that could go into the capital improvement fund in the amount of
$291,000, so, now we would have to remove this amount totally if the Board wishes to
set the tax rate at .43 cent per 100. Ms. Ferguson stated that she wanted to make the
Board aware that we are not going to bring in the revenue that was anticipated this year
because of the reduced reimbursement to us from the State.
Mr. Conrad stated that something needs to be conveyed to the State about what impact
their cuts are having on the localities.
Mr. Tanner agreed with Mr. Conrad in setting the tax rate at .43 or .44 cent per 100, but is
however, concerned about what impact this will have on the County next year.
Ms. Ferguson explained that at .43 cent per 100 we were anticipating one debt service
payment of $451,000 coming out of bond money and the balance of the shortage not
counting the $18,000 dollars that we have talked about adding back to the School budget,
coming from reserve funds. This amount is approximately $371,157. So we would need
to add $123,707 to that $371,157 and that is what would need to be taken from the
operating reserve in order to balance the budget.
Mr. Craft stated that if land use is adopted this will cause another change in the tax rate
for the next year. '
Mr. Tanner stated that he is not advocating raising taxes, but is concerned in what is
going to happen next year if we go with land use or not we need to be fair to the citizens
this year and mindful of what the future hold for us with this tax rate we set.
Mr. Carter made a motion to adopt the FY2009 budget with changes as discussed. Mr.
Moore seconded the motion.

advertised reducing the capital projects by $291,646 and adding back to the school
budget $18,710 dollars to allow them to receive all matching funds.
