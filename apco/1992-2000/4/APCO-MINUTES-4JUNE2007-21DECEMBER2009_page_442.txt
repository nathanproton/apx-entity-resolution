stating that on July 1, 2008 Campbell County, City of Bedford, Nelson County, City of
Lynchburg and Appomattox County partnered together to form the Region 2000 Services

reason is to better protect human health and the environment. Mr. Gibson stated that the
County also will benefit from being able to participate in the Regional Solid Waste Plan
