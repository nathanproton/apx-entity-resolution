lengthy agenda for this meeting and because they will require
considerable time including a video presentation. Since
these were not pressing matters, the Board agreed to the
postponement and to meet again November 4, 1992 at 5:00 P.M.
to discuss with Mr. Peterson the equipment needs at the
Landfill.
Mr. Peterson, then reported 822 tons of refuse were received
at the Landfill during September which was a decrease from
the 905 tons received during August. This equates to an
average daily volume of 42 tons in August compared to 37 tons
in September. 48 tons were recycled, gate billings were
$13,096.00, and 624 c.y. of brush was received during
September.
Mr. Torrence noted two (2) recent articles in the Appomattox
Times referred to monthly budgets of $60,185.00 for
collection and $240,311.00 for disposal and that these were
actually annual budget figures.
Mr. Peterson continued by informing the Board the State
Landfill Inspector, Mr. Timmons, visited the Landfill October
7, 1992. Mr. Timmons assured Mr. Peterson the landfill
operation was in compliance with regulations except at the
leachate collection tank where underground storm water was
discharging. The discharge here was "orangish in color" and
Mr. Timmons asked Mr. Peterson to continue to monitor the
discharge.
Mr. Peterson then reported the refuse collection bins at the
landfill entrance had been moved across the road for safety
purposes.
Mr. Carwile asked if any #40 gravel had been spread at the
Evergreen transfer site at Route 633. He had received a
complaint they were being used and that the gravel was too
large for a smooth surface treatment. Mr. Peterson informed
Mr. Carwile the #40 gravel was placed as a base and that it
would soon be "choked" with #57 gravel which will.smooth the
surface.
Mr. Jamerson asked if there were any further question.
Hearing none, Mr. Jamerson informed Mr. Peterson he would be
notified later when the Board would meet again to discuss the
equipment needs at the Landfill.

$20,709.00 for construction expenses at the primary and high
schools which will be reimbursed from the Literary Loan
Money, $55,263.27 for the Textbook Rental Fund, and
