Mr. Jamerson stated the analysis was based on actual first
quarter (July through September, 1992) FY93 figures.
$8,173.00 had been spent on trash "collection" for the
quarter and $60,185.00 has been budgeted for the year.
Therefore, the County is operating considerably under budget
so far this year. Trash collection covers the cost of
operating the collection trucks serving the transfer sites
throughout the County, picking up the trash from the "green
boxes", delivering the trash to the Landfill for disposal,
and cleaning up and maintaining the transfer sites.
$240,311.00 has been budgeted in FY93 for "Disposal" and
$53,937.00 was spent during the first quarter of FY93. This
also is under budget for the first quarter. The "Disposal"
covers costs for operating the Landfill including paying
part-time employees who, incidentally, spend part of their
time working on "Collection".
Bond repayment for FY93 will be $257,942.00 or approximately
$65,000.00 per quarter. Therefore, of the $558,438.00
budgeted for the Landfill operation, collection, and bond
repayment; approximately $127,110.00 ($8,173.00 + $53,937.00
+ $65,000.00) has been spent in the first quarter of FY93.
Also, $47,333.00 has been collected in "User’s Fees" during
the first quarter. This means the net cost to the County for
the first quarter FY93 was $79,777.00.
Based on scaled recordings, an average of 11,000 tons of
trash per year are disposed of at the Landfill or about 2,750
tons per quarter. Therefore, $79,777.00 divided by 2,750
tons equals about $29.01 per ton.
Also, the County is setting aside $150,000.00 each year to
help pay to close the new cell scheduled to be opened by
January 1994. $150,000.00 divided by 11,000 tons equals
$13.64 per ton and $13.64 + $29.01 equals $42.65 per ton
which represents the actual cost to the County based on first
quarter FY93 expenses.
Mr. Jamerson next considered the budgeted costs. These
figures, using the same method of analysis, indicates a cost
of $47.19 per ton.
Mr. Jamerson then explained his analysis of costs if the
County were to use the proposed private landfill at Amelia.
The owners recently proposed a $29.00 "tipping fee".
Transportation costs would be about $9.00 per ton based on
their proposal and the figure recently presented by Draper
