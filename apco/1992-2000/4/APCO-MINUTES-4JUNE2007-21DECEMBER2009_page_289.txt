Whereas the Commonwealth faces a documented transportation funding shortfall including a
recurring and inflating road maintenance funding shortfall resulting in the Commonwealth
Transportation Board eliminating and reducing programmed project spending totaling $1.1
billion in the new six-year transportation programs; and
Whereas the Virginia Department of Transportation is transferring almost $400 million in Fiscal
Year 2008 from road construction funds to support road maintenance activities;
Whereas the eliminated and stalled project monies include primary, urban and secondary
construction funding reductions to regions and localities of up to 44 percent for Fiscal Year
2009; and
Whereas funding for new highway and bridge construction is diminished as the annual road
maintenance shortfall continues to escalate and the estimate to repair the Commonwealth’s 1,700
deficient bridges totals more than $3 billion; and
Whereas regions of economic importance to the Commonwealth, including Hampton Roads and
Northern Virginia, confront major transportation funding challenges in addition to those shared
by all other areas of the Commonwealth; and
Whereas transferring state general funds to transportation neither adequately supports
documented and recurring transportation infrastructure investment needs, nor serves to protect
the Commonwealth’s additional core services including public education, health care, mental
health and retardation, and public safety; and
Whereas Virginia has the nation’s seventh lowest motor vehicle sales tax rate and the
Commonwealth last enacted dedicated, new, significant and recurring annual statewide revenues
for transportation in 1986, including the last increase in Virginia’s modestly low gas tax rate of
17.5 cents per gallon; and
Whereas since 2006 the Commonwealth has enacted significant reforms to improve the
coordination between transportation and local land-use planning.
Now, therefore, be it resolved that the County of Appomattox hereby calls on the Governor of
Virginia and the Virginia General Assembly during the forthcoming transportation special
session to enact a significant transportation funding package to include dedicated, new,
significant and recurring annual revenues to address the Commonwealth’s documented
transportation infrastructure needs.
And, be it further resolved, that the Governor of Virginia and the Virginia General Assembly are
urged to enact dedicated new, significant and recurring annual revenues to eliminate the road
maintenance shortfall; increase funding directed to interstate and primary highways, urban and
secondary roads, and transit projects; guard against the transfer of general funds to
transportation; and address the unique transportation needs of specific regions of the
Commonwealth including initially Hampton Roads and Northern Virginia.
