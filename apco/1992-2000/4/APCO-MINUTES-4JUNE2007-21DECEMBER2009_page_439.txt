Chairman Conrad presented Administrative Item #2 —- VDOT Property Return Request
and called for discussion.
Ms. Ferguson stated that no action was necessary from the Board it was just a notification
process. Ms. Ferguson stated that basically VDOT tries to make the Board aware of any
changes to roads or when they plan to abandon parts of a right of way. Ms. Ferguson
stated that in the past the Board would have to approve these changes, but in recent years
legislation has changed and now the changes are made by resolution, so basically they are
notifying the Board and giving the Board the chance to ask any questions that they may
have. Ms. Ferguson stated that if the Board should have any questions she would be
glad to contact VDOT and get an answer.
Chairman Conrad next presented Administrative Item #3- Mt. Obed Baptist Church
Dedication and explained that this was an invitation to the Board and if any member

a count of who will be attending.
