‘Chairman Conrad presented Administrative Item#4- State Hiring Freeze and explained that
Sheriff Staples has approached the County Administrator with a major problem that has come up
due to two officers quitting within the next month. The State has a hiring freeze in place and
therefore, he would be unable to fill these positions for at least three months. Officers would then
have to be trained and go to school which would mean that it would be five to six months with
him being two officers short. Chairman Conrad stated that Sheriff Staples is requesting that the
Board allow him to fill these positions and have them in school by July 2009 in order that he will
not be without officers for six months. Chairman Conrad stated that the funds are already in the
budget but it would mean that there would be no State reimbursement for these two positions for
at least 90 days.
Mr. Craft made a motion to approve Sheriff Staples request to fund these two positions until the
State hiring freeze is lifted.
Mr. Tanner seconded Mr. Craft’s motion. Chairman Conrad called for discussion, hearing none,
