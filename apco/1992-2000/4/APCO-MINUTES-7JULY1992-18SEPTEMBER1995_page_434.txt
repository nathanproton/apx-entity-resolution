Mr. Torrence next recognized Mr. Dan Arritt.
Mr. Arritt came forward and gave his address as Route 5, Box 330,
Appomattox, Virginia. Mr. Arritt began by stating that he worked for
Armstrong Furniture and that some of their executives were relocating
to the Appomattox Plant. He continued by stating that he surveyed
these people to see why they were not proposing to live in Appomattox
County and found that the number one reason was accessibility to
entertainment and the number two reason was the school system. Mr.
Arritt requested the Board level fund the schools so that the County
could compete with other areas in the field of education.
Mr. Torrence thanked Mr. Arritt and stated that if no one else had any
comments, the meeting would be closed.
Ms. Renee Hoffman asked if there could be a show of hands of the people
who were there supporting level funding of the school budget.
Mr. Torrence stated that this would be appropriate.
(All present raised their hands.)
Mr. Torrence closed the public hearing on the proposed FY95 budget at
6:50 P.M.
