A RESOLUTION CALLING UPON CONGRESS TO PROPOSE AN AMENDMENT TO ARTICLE
OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION THAT WILL ENABLE THREE-FOURTHS OF THE
STATES TO AMEND THE CONSTITUTION SUBJECT TO CONGRESSIONAL VETO.
WHEREAS, All 33 amendments proposed to the United States Constitution
since 1978 have been initiated by Congress; and
WHEREAS, More than 400 petitions from the several states requesting a
constitutional convention to propose amendments have been filed with
Congress but have never resulted in the calling of a convention or
adoption of an amendment; and
WHEREAS, There should be a proper balance of national and state power
in a federal system; the present mechanism for the states to initiate a
constitutional convention has proved to be unworkable; and the
envisioned and desirable balancing of powers between national and state
powers requires a means for the several states to be able to propose
amendments to the Constitution; and
WHEREAS, The governing bodies of several Virginia localities have
requested the Virginia Municipal League to support an amendment to
Article V of the United States Constitution; and
WHEREAS, This amendment was developed by the Council of State
Governments following considerable study about how to more
appropriately adjust state and national powers in this federal system
of government; and
WHEREAS, The council on State Governments proposal is to enable the
legislatures of three-fourths of the states to propose amendments to
the Constitution subject to the veto of the Congress by a two-thirds
vote of both Houses within two years of the states’ submission of the
amendments; and
WHEREAS, The Virginia General Assembly and state and local entities
across the United States are joining in support of this proposal; and
WHEREAS, This proposal embodies a prudent method for constitutional
amendments; now, therefore be it
RESOLVED, That the Appomattox County Board of Supervisors supports the
foregoing proposed constitutional amendment; and further
RESOLVED, That this resolution shall be presented to the Virginia
Congressional Delegation and governmental leaders at the state and
local level in Virginia.
Vote: Mr. Moore, aye; Mrs. Beasley, aye; Mr. Carwile, aye; and Mr.
Paulette, aye.
