Mr. Carter questioned if there is no way to know about the health insurance premiums. Mr.
Perrow stated that the actuarial prediction is a 16% increase; however if there are no major health
issues this year, it may be reduced.
Mr. Conrad questioned that if the projected budget is based on an ADM of 2130 and in actuality
it is 2109 what would happen to the difference? Dr. Boone explained that it would be added to
the deficit as it has been done in previous years.
Dr. Boone explained that the current student count is 2176 and he feels that the decline in student
ADM is due to high population of private school and home schooled students.
