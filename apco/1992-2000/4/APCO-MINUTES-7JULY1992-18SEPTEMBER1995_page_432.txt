Mr. Torrence, Chairman, presiding, called the meeting to order at 7:00
P.M.
Mr. Moore gave the invocation.
Ms. Ferguson presented the Board with the final draft of the FY95
budget and the FY95 proposed revenue estimate. Review followed.
At 7:15 P.M. Mr. Torrence recognized Dr. Thomas, Superintendent of
Schools, and asked him to appear before the Board to express his
concern over budget reduction for the schools.
Dr. Thomas began by expressing that he understood the position of the
Board in having to look at the needs of all offices but continued to
say that he had two (2) major concerns with the schools $85,000.00
budget reduction.
Dr. Thomas pointed out that taking the debt service on the million
dollar VPSA loan into consideration, the schools were being funded
$32,430.00 less in local funds than last year. Dr. Thomas stated that
these were actual dollars that reach children.
Dr. Thomas’ other concern was that last year we were one of five
divisions that were noted as cutting local dollars when more State
dollars were being given.
Mr. Torrence explained the Board’s position and expressed that the
Board had done everything they could to meet all the county needs.
Discussion followed with Dr. Thomas explaining school needs and ideal
conditions.
Dr. Thomas requested that the Board of Supervisors at least level fund
the FY94 amount.
Dr. Thomas also, requested that if FY94 sales tax money comes in, in
Fy95, that the Board agree to supplement his budget by that amount.
Discussion followed with no final decision being made on Dr. Thomas’
request.
After discussion, Mr. Torrence thanked Dr. Thomas, and being no further
