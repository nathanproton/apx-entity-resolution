It has come to our attention that Appomattox County is in the process
of applying for the second phase of a Transportation Enchancement
Program grant. Appomattox Court House National Historical Park
continues to support this program and your efforts to secure this
grant. If we can be of any assistance in this endeavor, please let us
know.
Once again, we wish you good luck with your grant application.

Dear Mr. Martin:
As the Appomattox County Chamber of Commerce is deeply involved in
developing our tourism industry here in Appomattox, we are also
interested in ways which will better market and highlight our fine
community and its assets. To this same end we are also involved in twa
regional efforts which feature Appomattox and it’s heritage. One of
those regional efforts is the "Route of Lee’s Retreat" being developed
between Petersburg and Appomattox. We feel this goes hand in hand with
the recent opening of our Visitor Information Center and other related
efforts taking place in the county.
We, therefore, submit this letter in support of the application for
funding the "Route of Lee’s Retreat" project.
Sincerely,
Rebecca Nix, President
Appomattox County Chamber of Commerce
