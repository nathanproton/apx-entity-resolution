Option "F" - a one (1) foot thick clay liner for the leachate
collection pond
Option "G" - a 60 mil thick synthetic liner for the leachate
collection pond
The costs of each option and several combinations of options was
considered and discussed at length. Since several Board members felt
they needed more time to decide the best combination of options, Mr.
Jamerson set a meeting for tomorrow night: March 30, 1993 at 6:00 P.M.
to further consider the issue and asked Messrs. Dickerson and Peterson
to return then in case there were further questions.
At 7:00 P.M. Dr. Jack Thomas, Superintenclent of Schools, accompanied by
Mrs. Joyce Jamerson, Assistant Superinterident of Schools, and several
School Board members arrived as schedulecl. Mr. Jamerson recognized Mr.
Thomas and asked him to speak and present: the Schools’ FY94 budget
request.
Dr. Thomas presented each Board member a copy of the proposed budget
document and explained the anticipated revenue sources and proposed
expenditures. A proposed revised salary schedule for Schools’
personnel was also presented and discussed.
The proposed budget asks for $2,863,006.00 of County revenue money as
compared to $2,563,006.00 for FY93. The total budget requested is
$9,970,683.00 compared to $9,426,895.00 for FY93.
Dr. Thomas pointed our revenues from Statie sources was about $36,249.00
less than that received in FY93, revenue from Federal sources was some
$75,521.00 more than that received in FY93, and debt service would be
some $105,000.00 less in FY94 than FY93 because the bond for the
construction of the High School would be paid in full before the end of
FY93.
A proposed new position within the Schoo] Board’s administration office
was discussed. Dr. Thomas, addressed several questions from Board
members after which Mr. Jamerson asked for and received comments from
each School Board member present.
After hearing all comments, Mr. Jamerson thanked and excused Dr. Thomas
and informed those present the Board of Supervisors would consider the
budget request as in the past and advise the School Board in due time.
Mr. Jamerson next asked the Board to consider FY93 budget line item
transfer requests. After review, Mr. Torrence made a motion seconded
by Mr. Carwile to approve the following line item transfers:
