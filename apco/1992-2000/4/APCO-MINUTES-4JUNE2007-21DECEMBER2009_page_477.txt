Mr. Conrad stated that he wanted to make a comment on the letter that was submitted to
the Letters to the Editor in the Times Virginian this week regarding the shelter site.
Chairman Conrad stated that during this snow storm he had been in the County
Administrators office and the decision was made to open the shelter after cleaning the
sidewalks of snow. On Monday, at 11:00 a social worker went to the shelter and only
one vehicle showed up at the shelter but was not requesting help from the shelter. There
was no further request for shelter on that day or the next day while Ms. Dixon was at the
shelter. A notice was posted on the door if shelter was needed who to contact. Chairman
Conrad stated that this letter that was printed in the Times Virginian was in error and the
site was open and available for shelter.
Chairman Conrad presented the upcoming meetings.
Mr. Tanner made a motion to adjourn the meeting at 8:10 p.m. Mr. Craft seconded Mr.
Tanner’s motion. Hearing no discussion, Chairman Conrad called for a vote: Mr. Carter,
