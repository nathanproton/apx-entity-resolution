Chairman Craft called the regular scheduled meeting to order at 6:30 p.m. and called on
Mr. Carter to deliver the invocation. Everyone joined in the Pledge of Allegiance to the
American Flag.
Chairman Craft welcomed everyone to the meeting and then called for setting of the
agenda.
Having no changes to the Agenda Ms. Ferguson stated that Mr. Overstreet, County
Attorney has a correction to the resolution on page one of the Board book. Mr. Overstreet
stated the code section needed to read 58.1-3524 instead of 58.1-35924.
Having no one sign up to speak during the Citizen Public Comment Period, Chairman
Craft asked Ms. Janet Belter if she would like to appear before the Board earlier than the
scheduled 7:00.
Ms. Belter stated that she really did not have anything to bring before the Board other
than she would like to answer any questions the Board may have at this time on the
resolution for Personal Property Tax Relief for eligible personal use vehicles for 2008.
