Mr. Roark stated that after speaking with Mr. Overstreet, he felt it would be better to
have this stated not only in the State Code but also our local code as well.
Mr. Roark explained that the next change would be an amendment to Section 3.24
Required Documentation to the Subdivision Ordinance. Mr. Roark explained that this
change is necessary to enhance the GIS parcel layer that is currently being developed by
Timmons Group. Mr. Roark explained that as we move forward, new parcels will be
added to the layer and by utilizing survey accurate data, the parcel layer will gradually
improve in accuracy and detail. Mr. Roark also explained that the digital information
will gradually be implemented over the next year. Mr. Roark stated that he had spoken
with a few of the surveyors that do business in the county and have found no objections.
Mr. Craft thanked Mr. Roark for the summary that he provided to the Board on all the
proposed changes.
Mr. Craft next welcomed Mr. Earl Dickerson to the Planning Commission.
Public comment was called for.
Having no public comment on the proposed changes Mr. Craft closed the public hearing
at 6:27 p.m.
