WHEREAS, the VDRPT has asked for public input on the needs, priorities and rail improvements to be
considered when developing the State Rail Plan; and
WHEREAS, the US 29 — Interstate 66 (Piedmont) rail corridor between Danville and Alexandria is home
to 30% of the State’s population; and
WHEREAS, the cities, towns and counties of the US 29 Corridor have experienced significant residential
and commercial growth and with it, significant increases in highway traffic, congestion and travel time on
through trips; and
WHEREAS, fifty years ago, the Piedmont Corridor was served by 22 passenger trains a day operated by
the Southern and C & O Railroads; and
WHEREAS, today, the Piedmont Corridor is served by only one daily round trip train (Amtrak’s
Crescent) between New Orleans and New York, and for stations north of Charlottesville, by an additional
train (Amtrak’s Cardinal) three days a week; and
WHEREAS, these long-distance trains are frequently overbooked, with most seats reserved for long-
distance ticket holders, the schedule is not conducive to business travel, trains are frequently late, and the
existing level and quality of passenger rail service offered by these trains cannot meet the demands of
business travelers, tourists, students or the traveling public; and
WHEREAS, the rising cost of oil and the environmental concerns brought on by carbon based emissions
have heightened the interest in energy efficient and environmentally friendly alternatives to the
automobile; and
WHEREAS, recognizing the Piedmont Corridor as an underserved market, Amtrak has recommended to
VDRPT that steps be taken to implement new Lynchburg to Washington rail service “as soon as possible”
including any capital improvements needed to the existing rail line by the host tailroad; and
WHEREAS, Amtrak reports that the addition of a second daily train can be accomplished easily and at a
relatively low cost; and
WHEREAS, ridership on the Piedmont Corridor can be expected to increase significantly as direct service
results in reliable, on-time trains with available seats; and
WHEREAS, the Route 29 passenger rail corridor is significantly under-served compared to the I-95
corridor, where the State has made massive investments for rail infrastructure and operations; and
WHEREAS, an application for State Rai! Enhancement Funds (REF) for capital investments in the
corridor in support of the proposed new Amtrak passenger service has been developed by Norfolk
Southern Railroad and is included in the list of projects recommended by VDRPT for inclusion in the
State’s 2009-2014 Six Year Improvement Program; now, therefore, be it
RESOLVED, by the Appomattox County Board of Supervisors this 2" day of June 2008, That the Board
of Supervisors urges the VDRPT to include enhanced passenger rail service for the US 29 (Piedmont)
Corridor in the State Rail Plan, specifically the proposed new daily direct service between Lynchburg and
Washington, D.C. and on to New York and Boston, as proposed by Amtrak; and, be it
