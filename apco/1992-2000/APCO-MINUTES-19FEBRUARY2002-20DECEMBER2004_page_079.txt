Mr. Austin discussed the County’s secondary portion of the 911 signs. The primary money for
these signs has not been funded at this time. He thinks the funds will be available sometime
soon. Does the County want to go forward with this project and be reimbursed by VDOT when
the funds are available? This will be discussed again at the June meeting.
Mr. Carter thanked and excused Mr. Austin.
Mr. Carter called Mr. John Wilson with the Appomattox Tourism Volunteers to address the
Board.
Mr. Wilson passed out some information and gave his presentation on the update of the activities
of his group. Mr. Wilson thanked the Board for their support. The brochures are expected to be
ready for mailing sometime within the next few days. They have also mailed computer generated
brochures to motor coach tour companies and also some school groups. These groups had
already scheduled trips to the National Park and were interested in the history that surrounds
Appomattox.
The Information Center located downtown has had an above average number of visitors so far
this year.
Mr. Carter thanked Mr. Wilson for their efforts and the update.
