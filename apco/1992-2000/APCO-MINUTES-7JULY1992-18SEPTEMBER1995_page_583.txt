Carwile to adopt the following resolution:

Concerning locating State Prisons in Appomattox:
WHEREAS, The State Department of Corrections has been offered a tract
of land in Appomattox County for the location of a state prison;
and
WHEREAS, from all indications the vast majority of local citizens
adamantly oppose such a prison in Appomattox; and
WHEREAS, Governor Allen has promised that he would not put prisons
where they were not wanted; and
WHEREAS, the State does not pay local taxes and would possibly take
over one million dollars of real estate out of county tax base;
and
WHEREAS, the Town water and sewage systems are presently at or near
capacity and needs very costly major upgrading to meet our
future needs and the State will only pay for the additional needs
they have; and
WHEREAS, such a facility would overburden our court system,
commonwealth attorney’s office, sheriff’s department, volunteer
fire department, and rescue squad; and
WHEREAS, the Appomattox County Court House National Historical Park is|
located in the county and therefore creates a major historical
significance for our county;
NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED; that the Appomattox County Board of
Supervisors strongly oppose the construction of State Prisons of
any kind anywhere in the County of Appomattox.
Vote: Ms. Beasley, aye; Mr. Carwile, aye; Mr. Moore, aye; and Mr.
