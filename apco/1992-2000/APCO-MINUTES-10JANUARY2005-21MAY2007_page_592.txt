Paul Lee, Auditor with Robinson, Farmer, Cox Associates:
Mr. Lee is appearing to present the FY2006 Financial Report for the County of
Appomattox.
Mr. Lee did a review of the Financial Report and stated that the fixed assets and
liabilities will give you an idea of where you are going. From a financial health point the
county is in good shape. The General Fund did go down last year, but only about one-
half of what was budgeted. The fact that we have been able to put money aside in
Capital Projects over the years, has helped a lot. Tax collection wise, we were down a
little this year as compared to the last ten (10) years, but by next year you sould be
back up to where you were normally. There were no real problems within the county.
Every department was very cordial in helping them gathering the information they
needed.
