Mr. Carter then called for Supervisor Concerns — Item 12:
Mr. Conrad is concerned about the Waterline issue. At the last meeting, the Board
voted in favor of the waterline. During the time we were discussing this issue, getting
facts and information in order to make a good viable decision, we had people who
attended the meetings that were very vocal as far as their opposition to this. At the
Railroad Festival, this weekend, he had over a hundred people approach him with “Good
Vote, you did what you had to do. You studied all the information and did what we
depended on you to do”. He feels that a lot more people were in favor of this waterline
than we actually knew. He was encouraged by the comments he received over the
weekend.
Mr. Moore agreed with Mr. Conrad as he too has received some good comments on the
decision made on the waterline. He has had many phone calls and personal contacts
from people in agreement with the Board’s decision, but not any negative comments.
Mr. Carter stated he too, had been receiving good comments. He would also like to
have the Board of Supervisors send a letter to the Railroad Festival Committee thanking
them once again for a job well done for bringing revenue into the County and for also
making a family atmosphere type festival.
Ms. Ferguson will compose a letter to this effect.
