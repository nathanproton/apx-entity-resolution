Re: Conditional Zoning
Dear Sirs:
This is a request for Conditional Zoning for my home site lot
located adjacent to Route 691 approximately 650’ east of
Route 719 in Appomattox County. The lot is identified as
Parcel A on the attached plat and is Zoned R-1.
I am asking to demolish the existing 1 1/2 story log
structure and to erect a mobile home with a_ permanent
foundation. The log structure in which I currently reside is
dilapidated beyond practical repair. There are other mobile
homes in the area on property which is also Zoned R-1. I
understand the purpose of Conditional Zoning is to provide a
method for permitting the reasonable use of land and contend
such is my case.
I voluntarily proffer the following conditions:
1. The mobile home will only be used as my primary
residence.
2. The existing 1 1/2 story log home will be demolished
and properly disposed of prior to the erection of the
mobile home or, at least, within 60 days after the
erection of the mobile home.
3. After demolition of the log structure and erection of
the mobile home, the lot will be maintained in a neat
and orderly fashion.
4. The mobile home will be situated on the lot similar to
that shown on the enclosed plat and sketch.
5. Should I decide to move or _ sell the property, the
mobile home will be removed.
Also attached is some other information that may be
pertinent.
Thank you for considering this.
Yours truly,
Charles Hunter Phillips
