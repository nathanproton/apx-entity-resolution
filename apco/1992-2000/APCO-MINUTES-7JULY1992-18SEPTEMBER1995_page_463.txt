Counts & Dobyns the following quote was received for clearing,
grubbing, and moving clay from the new area:
A. Clearing & Grubbing (use brush for brush barrier) $2,500.00
B. 9000 cu. yd. of dirt hauling approximately
2500’ one way. $.65/cy. 5,850.00
TOTAL QUOTE $8,350.00
After Mr. Torrence’s explanation, Mr. Carwile stated that he understood
the need to approve this add-on but he was concerned that Hurt &
Proffitt had designated area "H" as having sufficient clay for closure
and now that we are well into the contract, the clay is not there.
Discussion followed concerning the engineering work done on this job
and concern that Hurt & Proffitt should make an adjustment to the
County due to this error.
Mr. Moore made a motion seconded by Mr. Carwile to approve $8,350.00 be
added to Counts & Dobyns contract for:
A. Clearing & Grubbing (use brush for brush barrier) $2,500.00
B. 9000 cy. yd. of dirt hauling approximately 2500’
one way $.65/cy. $5,850.00
Vote: Mr. Torrence, aye; Mrs. Beasley, aye; Mr. Carwile, aye; Mr.
Moore, aye; and Mr. Paulette, aye.
Mr. Carwile next suggested that the County Administrator write a letter
to Hurt & Proffitt stating the Board’s concern with this matter.
Mr. Torrence next requested that the Board approve a line item transfer
to reimburse Judge Lawson for a fax machine. After discussion, Mr.
Carwile made a motion seconded by Mr. Paulette to transfer $208.91 from
1101-5804 to 1205-7001 to reimburse Harry Lawson for fax machine for
Juvenile & Domestic Relations court. Vote: Mr. Torrence, aye; Mrs.
Beasley, aye; Mr. Carwile, aye; Mr. Moore, aye; and Mr. Paulette, aye.
Mr. Torrence next brought the Board up to date on the status of the
container site at Nash’s mobile home park. Mr. Torrence explained that
he had spoken with Mrs. Nash and she is willing to allow the County to
leave these containers on her property until September 1, 1994,
provided the site is policed on a daily basis.
Mr. Torrence next asked the Board if they wished to publish the
delinquent tax list in the Times-Virginian.
After discussion, and by consensus of the Board, it was agreed that
Mrs. Ferguson confirm the quote with the Times-Virginian and bring back
to the Board at the August 1994 regular meeting.
The Board having considered all items on the Special Meeting Notice,
adjourned at 7:00 P.M.
