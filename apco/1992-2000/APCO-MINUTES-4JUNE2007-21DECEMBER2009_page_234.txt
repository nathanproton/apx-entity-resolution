Chairman Craft presented the Informational Items and with no further discussion, called
on Mr. William Hix to come appear before the Board.
Mr. William Hix approached the Board and gave his address as 6834 Hixburg Road,
Pamplin, Virginia 23958. Mr. Hix first thanked the Board for giving him the opportunity
to speak with them and stated that he had requested an appointment to speak with the
Board to ask them to consider looking at the land use issue again. Mr. Hix stated that the
assessor who did his reassessment did not even get out of the vehicle and Mr. Hix stated
that he did go to the Community Center and met with the assessor and requested them at
the hearing to come back and take a look at his farm and they refused. Mr. Hix stated that
when you have as much land as he has you do have some swamps and rocky hills.
Mr. Hix gave a handout(Board File) to the Board and explained that his interpretation of
the handout is that if you own 200 acres in your first lot and another piece of land that is
not five acres, and they are within a mile radius you can put them together. Mr. Hix
explained that he had given this same handout to Watkins Abbitt and he is going to take it
to Richmond to see what can be done.
Mr. Hix then asked Mr. Overstreet if he was familiar with any of the information that he
had given the Board.
Mr. Overstreet stated that he was familiar with this information and explained the
handouts are two different code provisions and the first one referred to is used by most
counties and that is Section 58.1 -3231 the next section that was presented is establishing
districts, or special taxing districts which is a more complicated issue and does as much
ill as it does good. Mr. Overstreet stated that this is why the Board is looking at what
most counties use which is the 58.1-3132 which is five acres of land or more and anyone
that has the property introduction of agriculture purposes is eligible for this.
Mr. Hix stated that he has been paying $10,400 a year tax on land alone and with his
figuring at the tax rate at .49 per 100, he would now have to pay $22,000 - $25,000 a year
