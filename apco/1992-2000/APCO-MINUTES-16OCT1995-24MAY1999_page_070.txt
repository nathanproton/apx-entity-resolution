Mr. Paulette reconvened the meeting of March 4, 1996 and stated there
were several items that needed to be discussed. The first item for
discussion was the proposed Juvenile Detention Agreement with the City
of Lynchburg.
Mr. Carwile began by stating he had not had the time to review the
revised agreement, but felt this agreement was looking much better than
the original agreement. Mr. Carwile continued by pointing out several
areas of the agreement which were of concern to him.
A lengthy discussion followed with each Supervisor pointing out various
things for discussion in the proposed lease.
By consensus of the Board, Mrs. Ferguson was instructed to have the
County Attorney review the new proposed agreement and meet with the
Board March 12, 1996 to give his opinion on the changes in the proposed
agreement.
Mr. Paulette next asked the other Board members if they wished to
proceed with the sealed bid process on the three (3) old county cars.
