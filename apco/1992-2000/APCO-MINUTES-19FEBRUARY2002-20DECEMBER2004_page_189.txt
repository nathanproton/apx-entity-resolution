5. Board of Supervisors/School Board Planning Retreat: There has been some
discussion between the School Board Administration and the County Administration
staff regarding ways to improve working relations between the two Board. Staff is
recommending that the Board of Supervisors give strong consideration to holding a
planning retreat that would include the members of the Board of Supervisors and
School Board as well as selected top staff of both organizations. One option is a
facilitated workshop hosted by Lynchburg College at a cost of approximate $1,000,
not including food. (cost to be split between two Boards). Possible dates are January
11, January 18, and February 1, 2003. All dates are Saturdays.
After some discussion, most of the Board members felt it was not necessary to hold such
a retreat. It was the consensus of the Board not to participate in this type of retreat
largely based upon the $1,000 expenditure.
