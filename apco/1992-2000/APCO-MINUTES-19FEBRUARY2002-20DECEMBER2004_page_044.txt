8. Judge Poston continues oversight and resolution of any disputes during construction until
Certificate of Occupancy is issued, at which time the case is dismissed.
Mr. Cornwell recommends that the Board of Supervisors accept this proposal.
Mr. Kendrick had a question regarding item 5 - “If the joint courthouse plan agreed to and the
Board of Supervisors seeks first to build a new courthouse...” This basically implies that it would
be up to the Board of Supervisors which plan they may want to enact. Is that what you read this
to be?
Mr. Cornwell stated that seems to be the implication. This is their language, not ours. This is the
language given to us and we have not discussed the particularity of that language or what their
intent was. He reads it the same as Mr. Kendrick does.
Mr. Kendrick made a motion seconded by Mr. Moore that the Board accept this Proposal as
written and presented. ROLL CALL VOTE: Mr. Kendrick, aye; Mr. Moore, aye; Mr. Carwile,
aye; Mr. Hancock, aye; and Mr. Carter, aye.
Mr. Carter thanked Mr. Byrd and Mr. Cornwell for their time and efforts.
Mr. Carter asked if there was a motion to adjourn this special meeting.
At 7:52 p.m. Mr. Moore made a motion seconded by Mr. Hancock to adjourn. Vote: Mr. Carter,
aye; Mr. Hancock, aye; Mr. Carwile, aye; Mr. Moore, aye; and Mr. Kendrick, aye.
