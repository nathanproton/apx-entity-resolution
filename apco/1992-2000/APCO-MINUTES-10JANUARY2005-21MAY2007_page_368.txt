may save money in the long run by having one person coordinating services to make
sure that the child is getting the best services for the money. This may mean that a
child in an expensive residential placement leaving sooner and stepping down to less
restrictive service thus saving thousands of dollars. Some of these residential
placements can cost as much as $100,000.00 a year.
It is the desire of the CPMT that the Board would see this as a community collaboration
and hire a CSA Coordinator/Case Manager.
Mr. Elder answered some questions for the Board members.
Mr. Carter thanked Mr. Elder for his excellent presentation.
Mr. Elder next stated that he would like to thank the Board for considering their modest
request for a budget increase. A new requirement that has been placed on Social
Services is that when a Social Worker goes into the Court Room, they must be
accompanied by an attorney. We will have to hire an attorney every time one of our
Social Workers goes to court. Once again, this is without any additional funding from
the State but is a requirement that has to be met. They have signed contracts with two
(2) attorneys who have given them good deals but this is not included in their budget.
Ms. Ferguson explained that the Social Services Budget increase was approximately
$14,944.00 locally.
Mr. Carter thanked Mr. Elder for being present.
Ms. Ferguson stated that now that everyone has had time to review the Budget, she
recommends that they review each departmental request and discuss any questions that
anyone may have.
Mr. Conrad stated that there were several items in the proposed budget that he thought
could possibly be reduced.
At 9:25 p.m. the Work Session was adjourned.
