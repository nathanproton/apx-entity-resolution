Department 3401 - Building & Housing
Sub-Division Fees - increased $3156 to $6000
(Based on charging $10 per zoning application where now there is no charge.)
The Board wanted the Building Department to take care of its self. Did not do this, but did double
all building permit fee and by doing so, it added some $25,000, bring Building Permit Fees to
$50000 of anticipated revenue dollars. This will bring this department to almost full funding, but
will not fund the Planner. This will bring in line with what surrounding counties are charging.
Mrs. Ferguson has talked with Sheriff Staples about generating more revenue through his
department. There are not a lot of things to change.
Parking Violations $5.00 can be raised to $25.00 generating $6,000.
Total from $10,000 to $16,000.
(The Judge can throw these out, if he does not agree)
Discussion continued on pros and cons of County and State Warrants.
Department 4204 -Landfill Users Fees:
(these fees are pretty much in line with that of surrounding counties).
We do not charge household users. There is no suggestion to change this.
We do charge a $50.00 a Ton fee once someone brings in over 12 cubic yards. Mrs. Ferguson
suggests eliminating this 12 cubit yard break and charge $50.00 per ton for everything that come
across the scales, (excluding household users) generating an additional $6,000 roughly.
Mrs. Ferguson suggest that if the School Board can get their figures in order by Thursday night, she
would like to make changes and rerun budget and meet again on Thursday to tie everything down
and schedule a budget public hearing for maybe May 8" but be prepared to set the tax rate by May
1* without extending the tax due deadline.
