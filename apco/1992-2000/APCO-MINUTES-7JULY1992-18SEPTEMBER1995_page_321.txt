Mrs. Lindsay concluded by stating that the priority list for the last
four (4) years of the plan does not mean that all of the roads listed
can be constructed. Ms. Lindsay explained that the first two (2)
years, the County’s unpaved road money is dedicated to specific
projects. The last four (4) years the County has an estimated
$850,000.00 projected. The work that is listed under the plan is much
more than $850,000.00 worth of work. This is just work that has been
identified as eligible and it will be up to Virginia Department of
Transportation and the Board of Supervisors to reprioritize this list
to determine, if the money becomes available, which projects will
actually go for construction.
Ms. Lindsay continued by saying that the fact that these roads are on
the priority list and in the Six Year Plan does not mean that the
construction will be completed. It just means that the financing and
the preliminary engineering will at least begin during this six years.
Ms. Lindsay explained that the projects on the end of the list will
begin to receive engineering funding during this period. This list
represents the best effort on the part of Virginia Department of
Transportation, the Board of Supervisors and request from citizens, to
identify the most critical needs of the County. Ms. Lindsay, stated
that this concluded the reading of the Revised Six Year Plan.
Mr. Jamerson called for any questions.
Mr. Torrence questioned that on the unpaved list Route 1112 and Route
1111 would possibly be slated for construction in 1994.
Ms. Lindsay explained that this had been moved up on the list but funds
would not be available until 1996.
After discussion, Mr. Jamerson closed the public hearing.
