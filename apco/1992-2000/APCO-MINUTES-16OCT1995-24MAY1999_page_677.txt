Mr. Bosiger then called on Ms. Sandra Lindsay, VDOT Resident Engineer, to appear
before the Board.
Ms. Lindsay began by reporting that the Railroad was scheduled to begin work on the
lower crossing on Main Street on May 17, 18, and 19. Ms. Lindsay continued that during
this work the crossing would be closed. Ms. Lindsay explained that she is unaware of the
details but knows that the work should begin the week of the 17".
Ms. Lindsay then gave the status of the work to be done on route 632 and route 663. Ms.
Lindsay stated that the bids should be released by the end of the month and hopefully the
work could begin in July 1999.
Ms. Lindsay next told the Board that on April 15, 1999 the Commonwealth
Transportation Board allotted $350,000.00 to provide adequate access to Phase I
development of the Appomattox County Industrial Park. Ms. Lindsay continued that this
includes $300,000.00 unmatched industrial access funds, and $50,000.00 which will
require a $50,000.00 match from the County for a total of $400,000.00. Ms. Lindsay
explained that the right-of-way, environmental assessments, and utility easements are all
the responsibility of the County.
Ms. Lindsay asked if anyone had an item of concern for her?
Mr. Carwile asked questions concerning the industrial access funds.
Ms. Lindsay explained that Phase I included the first two lots in the park. The funds are
only for a road that goes to the two lots in Phase I. Ms. Lindsay explained that you might
access these funds for the next phase to continue the roads as you develop beyond Phase
I.
Mr. Moore asked if the sign at Oakville could be printed on both sides?
Ms. Lindsay stated she would look into this.
