P.S. Bill I gave a copy of this letter to Claude Allen Moore who’s on the zoning
committee.

Mrs. Ferguson:
It has been brought to my attention that a section of the old Norfolk-Southern property
located on Station Lane in Concord may be rezoned to M-1. As a property owner on
Station Lane I have concerns with Health and Safety. Increased traffic, and property
values need to be looked at as well.
To rezone this property to M-1 would open this small dead-end road to an increase of
traffic, and homeowners will have an Industry in their front yard.
We have a small child, and as he grows up we don’t want to be concerned about what is
across the street.
I ask you to think about the effect rezoning will have on this area. To rezone this one
property will affect several property owners as well as the community.
Sincerely,
Mr. E.M. Martin
