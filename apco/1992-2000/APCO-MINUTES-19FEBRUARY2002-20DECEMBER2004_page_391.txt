Allowing road names to be changed jeopardize the implementation of the E911
system This matter appears to be one of conflicting spelling as the lake is
“Townwanda” on the County’s tax parcel maps. .
After some discussion, Mr. Carwile made a motion seconded by Mr. Moore to correct the
spelling for a private road just west of Frank’s Place on Route 460 west from
“Townwanda” to “Tonawanda” as originally recorded on deeds. VOTE: Mr. Hancock,
aye; Mr. Carwile, aye; Mr. Moore, aye; Mr. Kendrick, aye; and Mr. Carter, aye. (5 aye
votes).
