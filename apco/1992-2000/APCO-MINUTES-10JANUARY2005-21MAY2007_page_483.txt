Mr. Carter the called for Supervisor Concerns:
Mr. Conrad - None
Mr. Craft - None
Mr. Moore - None
Mr. Carter stated he had one concern and he wished to make the following statement:
“The Appomattox County Board of Supervisors and the Appomattox Town Council have
elected from the multi water study alternatives, to proceed with negotiations with
Campbell County Water Authority in a joint related process. This process/mission is to
collect any and all financial data that will determine the cost of running a water line from
Concord to Appomattox. This information is needed along with other logistical data in
determining further steps to be taken in supplying the town and county with water.
A “Negotiating/Fact-Finding Team” was appointed that represented the Board and Town
Council along with a cross-section of town and county citizens to meet with Campbell
County and collect the financial impact it would have on our town and county
collectively. The focus point of this team would be a ‘UNIFIED TEAM”, collecting and
hearing the same information to disseminate back to the Council and Board. This would
allow the Team to format the information without enduring other barriers (different
committees and members) that would inhibit their reporting in a timely manner. Mr.
Wilson was asked to represent the town but declined and not naming another council
