9, Good Samaritan Clothing Exchange: St. Anne’s Episcopal Church has requested use of
the space under the health department for use as a clothing exchange. They are
requesting the use of the space rent free and on a temporary basis.
Mr. Carroll has suggested that the following conditions be applied: 1) St. Anne’s must
provide insurance coverage and the county be listed as a second insured. 2) the exchange
have specified hours of operation that are approved by the Board, and 3) that it be
emphasized that the use of this space is only temporary in nature and that it would be
appropriate for the exchange to continue to evaluate other locations.
Discussion centered around the fact that this was a good service to the citizens and along with the
conditions suggested by Mr. Carroll the following conditions also be applied. 4) anyone who
occupies a facility should be able to maintain the facility. 5) Determine who will be responsible
for the water, sewer and electric bills. 6) The County will give a 30 day notice to the Exchange
when space is needed by County.
