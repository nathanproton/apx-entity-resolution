Ms. Rockefeller continued to explain that in doing a comparison of the current costs as
opposed to the transfer costs, she had to use two (2) different tonnages. In the year
2004-2005, 12,000 tons came across the scales, 2,000 tons of that were charge for and
revenue was received. If we take our waste to a transfer station or anywhere else, we
would only be responsible to pay for 10,000 tons of that. The remaining 2,000 tons
came from businesses that would have to take their trash directly to wherever they
choose to take their waste. Therefore, on the Cost of Operations currently are figured
on 12,000 tons because that is what the landfill handled and took care of. On the
Transfer figures she used the 10,000 ton figures because this is what we would be
taking to the transfer station. As you can see, the total cost for landfill operation would
be $806,000 which amounts to about $66.92 per ton. The total cost of using a Transfer
Station would be $659,000 which amounts to about $65.98 per ton.
Ms. Rockefeller also stated that even with using the facilities of a transfer station, there
would still be cost involved with our current landfill as there would still be engineering
services and costs involved in testing and maintaining the landfill after closing. Ms.
Rockefeller reminded the Board that her figures were all on the conservative side and
costs for operating our landfill could depend on how fast the “cell” was filled and also
the cost of transferring will more than likely increase from those figures used today.
After some discussion, Mr. Carter thanked Ms. Rockefeller for her report.
