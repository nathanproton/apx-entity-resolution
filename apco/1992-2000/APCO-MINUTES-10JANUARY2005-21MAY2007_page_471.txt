Mr. Carter next called for SUPERVISOR CONCERNS:
Mr. Craft remarked he had trouble with people coming in, making statements that are
not true, stirring up things. Several statements are continuously being made regarding
the water line coming from Lynchburg, etc. One such statement was regarding the
water supply in Farmville - that they draw water from wells and also from the
Appomattox River. He asked someone who works for the Town of Farmville and was
informed that 100% of their water comes from the Appomattox River. In 2002 when
they had the big shortage of water, they drilled two (2) wells with a combined capacity
of 150 gallons which they used for two (2) months. They have not used them since that
time.
