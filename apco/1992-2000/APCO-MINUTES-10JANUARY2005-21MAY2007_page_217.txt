Mr. Overstreet reminded the Board that we are a Dillion Rule State and we have to be
authorized by State Law to take taxpayers money and sent it out of state. The only
thing he can find in the State Statute is a donation to Charitable Associations and non
profit organizations located within the respective limits. (In Appomattox County or
outside the County, if said institution provides services to the County).
The Board by consensus decided not to accept this challenge and leave the donating to
the Katrina Hurricane Relief to individual County Residents.
