At 2:00 p.m. Mr. Carter called the Special Meeting to order.
Mr. Spencer explained that the purpose of the meeting was to adopt two
resolutions pertaining to extending a Letter of Credit for a VDOT Road Project at
the Industrial Park.
Mr. Carter commented. that due to the economic times we have all been going
through, we have ways and means of handling this. He feels this is appropriate.
Ms. Ferguson explained that there may be an avenue through VDOT to do repay
this money without actually putting out any funds. They may be able to run it
through the 6-year secondary roads plans and this would keep us from having to
come up with the full $230,000 right now. They are still working on this.
After some discussion, Mr. Moore made a motion, seconded by Mr. Conrad, to
approve the following Resolutions:
