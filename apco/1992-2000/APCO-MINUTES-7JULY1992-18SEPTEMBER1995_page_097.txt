The Public Hearing having been duly advertised was called to
order at 7:30 P.M. by Calvin Tanner, presiding. Mr. Tanner
stated the purpose of the hearing, explained the procedure to
be followed, and called Mr. Caldwell to read the first
petition to be considered.
Mr. Caldwell read petition 92-183 of Devonne G. Godsey who is
seeking a variance to section 904, 607.02, and 607.03 of the
Appomattox County Zoning Ordinance. Mrs. Godsey wishes to
install a mobile home on her 0.77 acre lot. This is to serve
as an additional single family dwelling on this lot for Mrs.
Godsey’s son and family. The property is zoned A-1. There
is insufficient lot area and yard requirements and setbacks
for the additional dwelling per paragraph 607.02, 607.03 and
904 of the Code. The lot, however, is remotely located,
invisible from the highway (Route 608), and the only
non-family neighbor, Emmette B. Drinkard, has stated he does
not object.
Mr. Tanner asked to hear comments from anyone opposed to or
in favor of the petition. Hearing none, Mr. Tanner asked Mr.
Caldwell to read the next petition to be considered.
Mr. Caldwell read petition 92-184 of Mr. Joseph R. Darden.
Mr. Darden is seeking a variance to paragraph 904 of the
Appomattox County Zoning Ordinance to permit him to construct
a garage on his 0.74 acre lot located on Route 635. The
garage as planned would leave but 10’ side yard set back.
Mr. Tanner asked to hear comments from anyone in favor or
opposed to the petition. Hearing none and being no further
petitions to consider Mr. Tanner declared the Public Hearing
closed at 7:42 P.M. foTM
