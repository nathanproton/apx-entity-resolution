Ms. Dixon, Director of Appomattox County Parks, Recreation and Tourism Development
has asked for guidance with the use of the gym at the Old Elementary School. Recently
she has received requests from groups or individuals asking to use the gym. In the last
year, the only groups to use the gym have been County recreation programs that are
supervised by her, the Appomattox 4-H Club, or the Appomattox Youth Sports program.
Many individuals and groups are asking to use the gym that do not have insurance, and
there is no one to supervise them or unlock and lock the doors. There is no custodian
or maintenance personnel to clean or fix maintenance problem when they occur.
Also the gym does need to be renovated. The bathroom is not in very good working
condition, ceiling tiles fall occasionally and the floors need to be stripped and refinished.
All these create a liability issue as well. She is suggesting that in the future the use of
the gym be handled in the same manner as the Community Center rentals. Individuals
