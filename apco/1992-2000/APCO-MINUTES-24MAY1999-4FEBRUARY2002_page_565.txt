At 7:00 P.M. Mr. Kendrick opened the Public Hearing and stated to those in attendance that the
Public Hearing is not the appropriate forum to engage in discussion on the petitions. Discussion
will take place during the Planning Commission meeting that will immediately follow the public
meeting in the Jury Room off to the right. We will begin a hearing of each petition with
comments by the petitioner, followed by comments from individuals to speak for the petition and
finally by individuals wishing to speak against the petition. As you approach the microphone,
please state your name, address and whether you are for or against the petition.
Mr. Kendrick then turned the meeting over to Mr. Brandon Stidham, County Planner.
Mr. Stidham read the first petition to be heard.
