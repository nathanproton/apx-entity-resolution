Dr. Krug began by handing out a printed presentation. He discussed several challenges that are
facing the school system in the upcoming years. He also discussed some of the accomplishments
of Appomattox County students over the last couple of years. Listing some of the outstanding
colleges and universities where our students have been accepted.
Dr. Krug also stated what the impact of a drastic reduction on the budget would have on class
size, programs, and resources for teachers and extra-curricular activities. The purchase of new
buses and bus maintenance would also be impacted. One-third of the County’s buses are 11
