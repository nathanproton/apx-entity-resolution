Mr. Moore stated that this was not a new tax, this has been in place for a long time and the
amount of the taxes would be about the same as it is now. The new tax is based on kilowatt hours
and not dollar amounts. Most monthly bills will not change whatsoever.
There was some questions regarding security lighting which does not go through the meter.
Mr. Moore then read the next proposed Ordinance Change:
