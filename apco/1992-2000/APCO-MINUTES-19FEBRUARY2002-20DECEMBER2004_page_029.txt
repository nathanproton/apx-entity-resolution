The voting precincts have had some work done, courtesy of the Administrator’s Office. Some
are not handicap accessible and some small things need to be done in this area. There is also the
question of the buildings not owned by the County, how do we address the owners with the
question of meeting the handicapped codes.
Mr. Carter questioned the salaries for Officers of Election - $1,450 to pay each election officer
$25.00 to attend training session. Is there a problem getting these officers to attend the training?
Mr. Underwood stated they would like to offer this as an incentive to show up. Right now, there
is no obligation to show up. When asked to come, a good number of them do, approximately
85%. If they were offered a little incentive and they do not show up, then you would not feel
obligated to ask them to serve another year.
Mr. Carter also questioned Telecommunications - Late charges. It was explained that the County
does not pay these late charges because of cross over of bills and payments in the mailing system.
Mr. Underwood explained that they also pay one person in each precinct $10.00 on election day
for the use of their personal cell phone so each precincts will have a phone.
