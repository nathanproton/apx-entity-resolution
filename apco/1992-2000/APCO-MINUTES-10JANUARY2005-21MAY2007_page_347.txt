Dixon has provided her monthly report for March 2006.
21. Veterans Wall of Honor Report: G. Howard Gregory, Public Relations Office
for the American Legion Post 104, has provided an update on the progress being
made on the Veterans Wall of Honor.
Mr. Conrad made a comment regarding Item #19 — Land Use Taxation. This is some
good data we have received and it is pretty much involved. In looking at this
information one could come up with some different scenarios. We are going to be faced
with this issue and there is no question about it. He thinks maybe some type of work
session would be necessary after we receive more information.
Mr. Craft feels that the Commissioner of Revenue should be asked to join in this
discussion. He should be able to provide some of the information that the Board needs
before making any decisions on this subject.
Mr. Armbrust also stated he had received several phone calls regarding how much this
would increase the taxes on their property. At this time, he is unable to provide an
answer.
Mr. Carter then asked for SUPERVISOR CONCERNS:
Mr. Armbrust stated he is still receiving phone calls concerning the Rescue Squad and
Land Use Taxation.
Mr. Craft stated he too, is receiving questions regarding the Rescue Squad and Land Use
Taxation.
