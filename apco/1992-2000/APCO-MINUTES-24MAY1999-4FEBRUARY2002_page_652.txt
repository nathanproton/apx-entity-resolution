3a. | Employee Health Insurance:
The School Board had sent a letter to the Board of Supervisors concerning the employee’scontribution to the health insurance program. Mr. Carroll had responded that theSupervisors needed more information and it was felt the best way to do this was to have ajoint meeting and discuss issues on both sides.
There was a very lengthy discussion concerning all employees being treated equally. Bothboards are in agreement on this issue.
The major part of the discussion centered around how to estimate the increase in health insurancepremiums prior to submitting the school budget for the fiscal year.
Mr. Carroll suggested that maybe we should start working on a proposal to be sent out in theearly Spring in order for us to have some numbers prior to budget preparation.
Also it was proposed that both the School Board and the County set up a separate account similarto a contingency fund for the purpose of covering insurance increases.
