the County.
Chairman Conrad presented Additional Item #7B- Oakville School Demolition and called
for discussion.
Ms. Ferguson stated that numerous issues have arisen concerning the demolition of the
old Oakville School and it is more involved than just adding an addendum. She feels the
best thing to do would be to cancel this project and then advertise again, at a later date,
once the issues have been settled.

for the reasons set forth in the report of the County Administrator pursuant to Sec. 2.2-
4319 Code of Virginia. Mr. Craft seconded Mr. Tanner’s motion. Chairman Conrad
