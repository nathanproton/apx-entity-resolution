should do this in a resolution form at some point, if we do prepare a lease. This
could be our “quid pro quo”.
Ms. Ferguson questioned if another Public Hearing would be necessary. If not, does the
Board want to have Mr. Overstreet draw up a lease agreement similar to the one we
have with Carver-Price Alumni Association to present to the Board in the near future.
Mr. Conrad questioned if Ms. Mitchel would be doing anything that would tie into the
County Code. Ms. Ferguson said “no”. If no improvements are made, other than what
has been discussed, she is not mandated to meet any other codes.
Mr. Conrad made a motion, seconded by Mr. Moore, to proceed with preparing the
necessary documents for the leasing of the Old Courthouse Building to Ms. Mitchel.
VOTE: Mr. Armbrust, aye; Mr. Conrad, aye; Mr. Craft, aye; Mr. Moore, aye; and Mr.
