Mr. Armbrust stated that when we talk about tourism and cleaning up, we as a Board
need to back up and have the new zoning person look at cleaning up some of these
areas.
However, his main concern is he has had several phone calls regarding the Rescue
Squad. Mainly they are about a paid rescue squad. He feels the volunteers do a
wonderful job but too often by the time a crew gets together, the injured/sick person,
gets worse. Many of these people stated they would be willing to help raise money or
whatever is necessary. He feels this is a major concern and that the citizens are willing
to go the extra mile and pay a little extra to make this work.
Ms. Ferguson, speaking on behalf of the Rescue Squad, stated they have missed a
couple of committee meetings and that will not get any better as the Board will soon be
starting the budget process. Also, there has been a change in leadership and they really
need to have a meeting.
Campbell County is trying to get some paid personnel, so we will be hearing from
Concord very shortly with a discussion in that area because we are not sure of the
impact this will have on Appomattox County citizens. Avenues are being pursued to see
what can be done to help with this situation.
Mr. Craft commented that he is still receiving a few complaints about the Rescue Squad
but they have slowed done somewhat.
