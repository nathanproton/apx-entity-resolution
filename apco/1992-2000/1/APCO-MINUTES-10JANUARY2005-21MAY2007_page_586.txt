This is not a lot of money to build roads with. Mr. Austin continued with reviewing of
project listed on the handout. The first seven (7) items concern countywide projects.
The Church Street Project is ongoing at the present time as well as Ferguson Street.
These two projects are already financed. The first real #1 priority is Route 613, Police
Tower Road; #2 — Route 604 -Promiseland Road; #3 — Route 636 — Rock Spring Road —
bridge replacement over Big Cub Creek. Some funding has already come in that is
restricted to bridge replacement — Federal funds.
The next projects for funding would be the “Unpaved Roads”.
Route 677 — Log Cabin Road — reconstruction & hardsurfacing
Route 686 — Bear Branch Road — reconstruction & hardsurfacing
Route 716 — Pine Crest Place — reconstruction & hardsurfacing
The only new road that has not been in the plan is Route 685 — Tanglewood Road —
reconstruction & hardsurfacing. This is a cut-across road connecting Routes 647 and
703. This is a very narrow road being traveled by buses and is in need of attention.
Mr. Austin asked if anyone had any comments or questions regarding this projection.
Mr. Conrad commented on Route 685 — Tanglewood Road. Fixing this road would save
an enormous amount of miles for the buses.
Mr. Craft commented on Route 639 — Poorhouse Road near the landfill.
Mr. Austin stated they did not do a traffic count on this road. The unpaved roads on the
projected list are for the first two years of the six-year plan. They do not project
beyond that because different needs and developments come up and traffic counts
change.
Durwood Royal asked about the first mile of Route 633. There is a lot of development
on this road and it is very curvy and there seems to be a lot of accidents on this portion
of this road. Mr. Austin will review the accident data for the first mile of State Road
633. Mr. Royal also asked what the requirements were to be classified as a rural major
collector. Mr. Austin said he did not feel that Route 633 was not in this classification.
Mr. Conrad commented on the improvement to Lee-Grant Avenue. These improvements
have improved the safety of this road tremendously.
Mr. Carter asked if anyone had called regarding Route 662 — Rose Lane. He said VDOT
may want to drop by and take a look at this road for pot-holes, etc.
Mr. Carter thanked Mr. Austin for the presentation.
