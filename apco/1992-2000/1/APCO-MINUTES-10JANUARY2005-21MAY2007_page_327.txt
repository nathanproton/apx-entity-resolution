ADMINISTRATIVE ITEMS: (Items 1 — 6)
1. AWAG: Ms. Diane Miller, Treasurer for Animal Welfare Action Group of
Appomattox, is requesting permission to use Courtland Field on Saturday, June
10, 2006, for a community event focused on companion animals. They have
provided a certificate of insurance with their request.
After some discussion, Mr. Craft made a motion, seconded by Mr. Moore to approve the
Animal Welfare Action Group’s request to use Courtland Field on Saturday, June 10,
2006. VOTE: Mr. Armbrust, aye; Mr. Conrad, aye; Mr. Craft, aye; Mr. Moore, aye; and

2. Appomattox County Planning Commission Recommendations: The
Appomattox County Planning Commission has submitted their recommendations
on petitions heard on February 21, 2006.
Petition #05-559 — Travis Ford: The applicant is requesting a Conditional
Use Permit to allow a vehicle graveyard on Route 460 between Route 609 and
Route 667. The subject property is 5.05 acres in size and is zoned Industrial
District M-1, Tax Map #60(4) B. The applicant’s business, Ragnarock, Inc., was
the beneficiary of a Conditional Use Permit granted to Hackett Enterprises on
August 1, 2005 which allowed the operation of a concrete contractor's facility on
this same parcel. Approval of this current request would result in vehicle
graveyard becoming a Conditional Use in the Industrial District M-1 and would
thus amend the County Zoning Ordinance (Section 170-25).
After a brief discussion, Mr. Conrad made a motion, seconded by Mr. Armbrust, to deny
the above mentioned Petition #05-559 of Travis Ford because it is not in the best
interest of the general public and is not consistent with the intent of Chapter 170-51 of
the Zoning Ordinance nor the Community Development Planned goals and objectives to
enhance the appearance of the county throughout the Richmond Highway (Route 460)
corridor. VOTE: Mr. Armbrust, aye; Mr. Conrad, aye; Mr. Craft, aye; Mr. Moore, aye;
and Mr. Carter, aye. (5 aye votes)
Petition #05-560 - Fred Jones: Applicant is requesting to rezone
approximately 122.21 acres located on Country Estates Road (Route 642)
between Red House Road (Route 727) and Church Street (Route 641) from
Agricultural District, A-1 to Residential District, R-1, for the purpose of developing
a single-family residential subdivision. Tax Map #’s: 76-A-19, 76-A-20, 76-A-28,
portions of 76-A-14 and 76-A-18.
Mr. Moore made a motion, seconded by Mr. Craft, to approve the above mentioned
Petition #05-560 of Fred Jones as submitted for reason of public necessity, convenience,
general welfare, and good zoning practice. VOTE: Mr. Armbrust, aye; Mr. Conrad, aye;
Mr. Craft, aye; Mr. Moore, aye; and Mr. Carter, aye. (5 aye votes)
