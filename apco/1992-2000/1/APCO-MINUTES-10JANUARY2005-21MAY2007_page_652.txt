Mr. Craft called Bill Cashman to address the Board.
Bill Cashman, Project Manager for URS Corporation: Mr. Cashman will meet with
the Board to give a brief overview of the Route 460 Corridor Study and discuss some of
the land use determinations and access management principles being discussed in the
draft study.
Mr. Roark stated that last year about this time, we were successful in obtaining a Rural
Transportation Planning Grant for FY07 to conduct a planning study of the Route 460
corridor from the west Town limits to the Campbell County line, a key stretch of highway
approximately 7.5 miles in length. The County envisions this corridor as being one of
the focal points of development in the county over the next 20 years.
