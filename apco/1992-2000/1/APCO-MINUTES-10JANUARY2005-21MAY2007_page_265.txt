At 6:00 p.m. Mr. Carter opened the Public Hearing and stated the purpose of the public
hearing was to receive comments on the proposed Six-Year Plan for Secondary Road
Improvements for 2006-07 through 2011-12.
Mr. Carter then turned the meeting over to Mr. Don Austin, Residency Administrator,
VDOT, Appomattox County, Va.
Mr. Austin gave a brief explanation of the 6-Year Plan and the road improvements
scheduled for 2006-07 through 2011-12. He stated that there was not very much
change in the plan from last year. They are continuing the work on Route 641 (Church
Street) and hopefully will complete this by next summer. As explained in the recent
work session, the Route 613 (Police Tower Road) project has been moved to the second
priority. Money has been allocated for the design and research for this project. We do
not know how expensive this will be regarding right-of-ways, etc. You will note that
Route 608 is no longer on the priority list. The unpaved roads that will be worked on
will be Route 659 (Phelps Branch Road), Route 677 (Log Cabin Road), Route 686 (Bear
Branch Road) and Route 716 (Pine Crest Place). These four roads will be scheduled for
surface treatment.
Mr. Austin also discussed the estimated costs of each of the projects and when each of
these projects will be funded.
Mr. Carter asked if anyone had any questions for Mr. Austin regarding the Appomattox
County VDOT Six-year Plan and Secondary Road Improvements for 2006-07 through
2011-12.
There was also some discussion regarding the sidewalks along Lee Grant Avenue and
Ferguson Street providing sidewalks between the Elementary and Primary Schools.
There were no comments at this time.
