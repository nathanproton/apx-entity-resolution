Mr. Carter asked a question regarding “Immediate Facility Needs”. Along with teachers
salaries, the cost of some of these needs is sort of scary, such as the smoke detection
equipment — a quarter of a million dollars. These really need to be addressed.
Ms. Martin commented that we owe so much to the staff, teachers and all of the school
division employees. They certainly help with the success of our students. We are
certainly a caring school division. This has been proven time and time again.
Mr. Conrad commented that as a school bus driver, he has noticed that over the last
couple of years there has been an improvement in the attitudes in the students on his
bus. He does not know if the school system has been looking a discipline more.
Wherever this improvement is coming from it should be noted and congratulations
given.
Mr. Waddell adjourned the School Board.
At 8:00 p.m. Mr. Craft made a motion, seconded by Mr. Conrad, to adjourn the Board
of Supervisors. VOTE: Mr. Conrad, aye; Mr. Craft, aye; and Mr. Carter, aye. (3 aye
votes — 2 absent).
