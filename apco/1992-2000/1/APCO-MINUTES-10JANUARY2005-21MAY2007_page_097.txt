move some funds that are presently designated for a turning lane on Route 460
at Route 609, to a traffic light at the shopping center. The reason for this move
is that we have no concrete plans at the moment concerning the turning lane on
Route 460 and they will be moving forward with the light at the shopping center.

2. Animal_ Pound Change Orders: Change orders for the animal pound
construction project have been received. These change orders total a decrease
in the construction cost of $15,050.00.
NOTE: We will be receiving another change order for a change in the drainage
system that is being installed in the building that will be an increase equal to this
decrease. The bottom line is, we are not realizing this decrease in the overall
project.
After some discussion, Mr. Craft made a motion, seconded by Mr. Armbrust, to approve
the change orders to the Animal Pound Project in the amount of a $15,050.00 decrease.
