adopt the following resolution.
After some discussion, Mr. Armbrust made a motion, seconded by Mr. Conrad, to adopt
the following resolution:

of the Circuit Court of Appomattox County, Va. at instrument #20302503, lot 7,
Fairfield Hills Subdivision was conveyed to “Appomattox County Community
Park Committee”; and
WHEREAS, said real estate was not formally accepted by Appomattox County,
