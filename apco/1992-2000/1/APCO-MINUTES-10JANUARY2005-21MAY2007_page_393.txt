BIOSOLIDS MONITORING ORDINANCE:
e The Health Department will allow localities to recoup the cost of monitoring the
land application of biosolids so long as the locality has adopted a local
ordinance stating such. This ordinance lays out the framework for monitoring
the land application of biosolids and then what procedure shall be followed for
reimbursement.
Mr. Roark discussed briefly the Biosolids Ordinance. One thing he wanted to point out
was our ordinance will require will sign be posted from all right-of-ways. If the property
is a corner lot, having a right-of-way on two sides, then we will require two (2) signs be
posted 14 days in advance of spreading biosolids. This ordinance will allow us to be
reimbursed for our expenditures.
