Mr. Carter then called for Supervisor Concerns:
Mr. Armbrust has some concerns regarding the water line issue. He thinks this is a
great idea and a lot of people agree that we do need more water. There are some
misconceptions. It has been mentioned several times that Cannon Oaks Subdivision has
been problems with their wells. No one he has spoken with knows of any problems in
Cannon Oaks.
Also the rumor that Fred Jones requested the town to run its water line down Route
727. isnotso. Mr. Jones is in the well business and he has not made this request to
the Town. He is for the water line and for the County to take on this project. If the
town needs water they should go through the County. Someone should have Mr.
Beatson of the Health Department and Mr. Jones or someone who knowa lot about the
well business and check to see just how much water the town does have, and what their
concerns are. Then may some of these misconceptions can be cleared up.
