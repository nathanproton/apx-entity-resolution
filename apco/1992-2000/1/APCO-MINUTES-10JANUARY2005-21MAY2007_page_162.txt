10c. HUD GRANT: For sometime now we have all be hearing about $150,000
appropriation that has been set aside at Virgil Goode’s request for Appomattox
County, to work with the Workforce Investment Center (old Carver-Price School).
This past week we received an application form from HUD and that would be the
vehicle for these fund to come to the County. Unfortunately, there is quite a bit
required with this application before we can even think of receiving any funding.
We are working to get this application completed and submitted. The amount of
this grant is not $150,000, it is 99.2% of $150,000. ($148,000).
