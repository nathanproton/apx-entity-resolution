2. Setting Tools and Machinery Tax Public Hearing: When the new PersonalProperty tax rate was advertised earlier in the year, the Tools and Machinery taxrate was not specifically mentioned.

requirements found in the Code of Virginia, a public hearing has already beenadvertised for October 16" at 5:45 p.m.
