Mr. Conrad had a question regarding having VDOT repair/improve a road. Who
is responsible for contacting VDOT.
Ms. Ferguson stated that this would probably have to be taken into consideration
at the meeting/public hearings for the Six-Year Plan and Secondary Road
Construction Plan. If this is repairing things such as pot-holes, etc. then they
should contact VDOT.
Mr. Carter asked Mr. Overstreet about the new alarm that Bedford County has
recently installed. Is this in connection with Homeland Security? Will this be a
mandated thing?
