WHEREAS, the Board of Supervisors will request the Industrial Development
Authority of the County of Appomattox, Virginia (the “Authority”) to issue, offer and
sell its lease revenue notes or bonds (the “Bonds”) to finance the acquisition, design,
construction and equipping of the Projects, with the Landfill Project financed with a ten
(10) year amortization at the interest rate of 3.84% per annum and the Animal Shelter
Project and the E-911 Project being financed with a fifteen (15) year amortization at the
interest rate of 3.96% per annum to accomplish certain purposes of the Virginia Industrial
Development and Revenue Bond Act (the “Act”), with the County providing its moral
obligation in support of the payment of the Bonds; and
NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Supervisors of the
County of Appomattox, Virginia:
1. The County hereby accepts the BB&T Proposal and instructs the Financial
Advisor and Bond Counsel to take all such action as necessary or appropriate to
conclude the financing as set forth in the BB&T Proposal by the issuance of the
Bonds of the Authority based upon the recommendation of the Financial Advisor.
The following plan for financing the costs of the Projects is approved. The
Authority shall use the proceeds from the issuance of the Bonds to finance on
behalf of the County, the acquisition, design, construction and equipping of the
Projects for lease to the County for a lease term not less than the term of the
Bonds at a rent sufficient to pay when due the interest and principal on the Bonds.
The obligation of the Authority to pay principal and interest on the Bonds will be
limited to rent payments received from the County under the lease agreement.
The obligation of the County to pay rent under the lease agreement will be subject
to the Board of Supervisors of the County making annual appropriations for such
purpose. The Board of Supervisors on behalf of the County has adopted this
resolution as its moral obligation to the repayment of the Bonds. The Bonds will
be secured by an assignment of rents to BB&T (the “Bank”) as the holder
thereof. If the Board of Supervisors exercises its right not to appropriate money
for rent payments, the Bank may terminate the lease or otherwise exclude the
County from possession of the Projects.
The County by acceptance of this financing agrees to indemnify, defend and save
harmless, to the extent permitted by law, the Authority, its officers, directors,
employees and agents from and against all liabilities, obligations, claims,
damages, penalties, fines, losses, costs and expenses in any way connected with
the Authority, the issuance of the Bonds or the acquisition, design, construction
and equipping of the Projects.
Nothing in this Resolution, the Bonds or any documents executed or delivered in
relation thereto shall constitute a debt or a pledge of the faith and credit of the
Authority or the County, and the Authority shall not be obligated to make any
payments under the Bonds except from payments made by or on behalf of the
County under the lease agreement pursuant to annual appropriation thereof in
