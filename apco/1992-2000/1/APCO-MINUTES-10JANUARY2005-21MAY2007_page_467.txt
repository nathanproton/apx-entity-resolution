would like the County's approval to proceed with our project of building a playground at
the new recreational park. Sincerely,
Girl Scout Troop 2026 — Anne Pierce Hunter, Loren Toddy, Mandy Dolan, and Patricia
Evans.
Mr. Carter asked if they had spoke with Ms. Dixon and if we have received any
comments from her.
Ms. Ferguson stated they are working with Ms. Dixon on the design and the location will
be reviewed and the project will be followed step by step by proper County
representatives.
Mr. Moore made a motion, seconded by Mr. Armbrust, to approve the request from Girl
Scout Troop 2026 to raise funds and construct a playground at the Appomattox
Community Park. VOTE: Mr. Armbrust, aye; Mr. Conrad, aye; Mr. Craft, aye; Mr. Moore,
aye; and Mr. Carter, aye. (5 aye votes)
Mr. Carter read the following statement about the County not donating to the
Community Park: “7he question was asked to me this past week-end on why the county does
not and will not support the youth of the county at the new Community Park.” My immediate
response was who possibly could make such an outlandish false statement. As I thought further,
I don’t know how much more the Board could do other than cut already drained budgets within
the county framework or raise taxes to some level that would appease some folks. This Board
has always supported the youth of our county in any kind of project/projects that could be
afforded either monetarily or verbally. This has always held true to all other previous Boards in
my life time. To make such a statement would have to come from not knowing the very basic
definition of the word “support” and the limitations of county funds.
Just to set the record straight, the county has provided the following support at the Community
Park:
