Proper assessment, which was not done in 2002. One thing he does not agree with
Augusta County on is the five (5) year history for the property.
At this point, Mr. Conrad, interjected some figures from Bedford County, that land use
has not curbed the growth of the county. According to what he sees, the majority of
our taxpayers would see a substantial increase in their taxes. He does not feel that
anyone wants to be paying these higher taxes. You stated a little while ago, that it does
not matter to you, well it matters to him.
Ms. Ferguson stated that when the Board asked her to check with VACo regarding land
use taxation, VACo indicated that the trend is moving away from land use taxation. This
was when she received the letter from Southampton County.
Mr. Mays stated that no other counties are going to see the increases that we see.
Mr. Mays suggested that the tax exemption for the elderly be raised from $15,000 to
$18,000. This would help some for those on fixed incomes.
Ms. Ferguson asked what Mr. Mays thought the increase in residential values. Most of
the talk has been about farm land and forest land, not much has addressed the subject
of residential property. He sees maybe a 10% increase in this.
There was more discussion on the increases on property values.
At 6:37 p.m. the meeting was adjourned.
