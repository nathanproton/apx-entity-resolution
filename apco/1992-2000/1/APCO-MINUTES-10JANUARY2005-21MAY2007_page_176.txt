16. Supervisor Concerns: Mr. Carter asked if there were any matters for
discussion at this time.
Mr. Conrad had some concern regarding Landfill issues. The public needs to be
informed that regardless of what the Board decides to do, our existing landfill will still be
used because there are still monitoring, engineering, etc. that will still have to be done.
It would be useful to have Ms. Rockefeller make a presentation monthly.
Mr. Moore agrees with Mr. Conrad’s suggestions and feels that the employees at the
landfill with years of experience will be able to carry on the day to day operation as long
as necessary.
