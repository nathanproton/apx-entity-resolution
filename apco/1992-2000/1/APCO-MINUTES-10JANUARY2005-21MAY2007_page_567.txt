Mr. Carter then called attention to the INFORMATIONAL ITEMS:
20. Appomattox County Public Schools: Monthly financial report for the school
system.
21. Robert E. Lee Soil & Water Conservation District: Minutes of the October
26, 2006 Board of Director's meeting.
Also received a letter from Linda S. Campbell, Chair, Virginia Soil & Water
Conservation Board requesting our support for the local Conservation District.
Mr. Carter then called for Supervisor Concerns:
Mr. Craft revisited the necessary repairs to the old courthouse roof. Apparently this is
a real problem for Ms. Mitchel and the theater group. The County needs to be sure that
anyone working on this building is certified and that they have insurance.
Mr. Carter asked if the Board wished to have Ms. Ferguson look into getting some
quotes on repairing this leaking roof.
