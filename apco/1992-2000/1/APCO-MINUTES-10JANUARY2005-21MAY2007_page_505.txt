Mr. Carter announced that due to the fact that the full Board of Supervisors was not
present and the serious nature of the called meeting, they would take a fifteen (15)
minute recess in order to try to reach Mr. Moore.
At around 6:45 p.m. Mr. Carter stated that due to the fact that they could not get in
contact with Mr. Moore, and the serious nature of the meeting, the Board will discuss
this issue at the meeting on October 2, 2006. Ms. Ferguson was instructed to contact
the Campbell County Administrator and ask that they withhold their proceedings until
after October 2", giving the Board time to meet. Hopefully, Campbell County will be
willing to work with us past the original deadline of September 15" 2006.
