Mr. Fore stated that Nelson County is a perfect example of what can be done through a
PSA.
After a short discussion period, Mr. Carter thanked Mr. Gillespie, Mr. Rogers and Mr.
Fore for their very informative presentation.
Mr. Carter asked if anyone had anything they wished to say.
Mr. Wilson said he would like to encourage you to send this back to Region 2000 for
another study. We started with a cost of $16.4 million dollars, then $5.5 million dollars
and now it is $1.4 million, and after we get our beautiful grants, we end up paying
$400,000 for a water line. If we send it back a couple more times, we may even get a
monthly royalty check, a pipe line and free water. He feels this is encouraging.
Mr. Carter asked if there was any other business to be discussed.
Mr. Spiggle stated the Town Council had a few items to discuss.
