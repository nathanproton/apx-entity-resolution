State have, is for SOQ (Standards of Quality) positions only. There are a number of
employees who do not come under this, but they receive increase as well.
Mr. Perrow said that they are lucky they have employees who want to live here or work
here and like the quiet of the community and not have to drive to Lynchburg or further
to go to work.
Mr. Carter thanked Mr. Perrow for coming.
Ms. Ferguson stated she had tried to stretch the revenue a little bit and tried to see
what she could do with the budget. After making the adjustments discussed on Monday
night she has made a bunch of adjustments and ended up adding $82,857 to the
expense, making the total budget $32,918,230.
She also did some re-evaluating on the revenue, so you can add $97,800 bringing the
total revenue to $32,142,905.
The reality of all of this is the short fall equals $775,325. One cent (.01) on the Real
estate generates $69,000. With no reductions anywhere in order to generate this
amount of money we would have to increase the tax rate eleven cents (.11).
Ms. Ferguson gave the Board an example of what the tax increase would amount to on
an assessed value of $200,000 and paying $1,440.00 now at .72 cents per hundred
now, then at .83 cents per hundred your taxes would be $1,660.00 increasing by
$220.00.
There was a lengthy discussion regarding the school budget.
State Money for the School: $13,840,568
Federal Money for the School: $1,435,222
Private moneys: $ 409,800
Total Reimbursement $15,685,590
School Budget Presented: $21,299,541
Revenue above $15, 685,590
Difference $ 5,613,951
Approximately $1.2 of this is Debt Service plus the $265,032 matching monies.
Bare minimum to meet SOL Standards for School Budget would be $5,348,925 of local
money and $21,034,509 Total.
Mr. Conrad is stated that if we raise the tax rate by .11 cents, we will have everyone on
our necks.
Ms. Ferguson stated she had plans to meet with Ms. Belter to see it there was any
possible way to take some funds from reserves instead of increasing taxes, if we come
out of this year better than we figured.
