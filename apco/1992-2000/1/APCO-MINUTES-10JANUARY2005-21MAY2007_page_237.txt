Ms. Ferguson stated she had given Mr. Overstreet a copy of the last RFP issued for the
re-assessment and they are working on getting a RFP out for the upcoming re-
assessment.
Ms. Ferguson asked if anyone had any questions for Mr. Mays and/or Ms. Belter
regarding the Land Use.
Mr. Conrad posed a question regarding the renting of farm land as opposed to lying
waste.
7:16 p.m. Mr. Moore arrived.
Mr. Mays stated you have to spread out your lost revenue — you cannot continue to drop
this entirely on the landowner. He gave several ways to accomplish this:
1. Partial year assessment
2. Business License in County (Merchants Capital Tax — Repeal — This is
basically a dead tax as it cannot be changed)
3. Personal Property Tax
4. Machinery & Tools Tax
If we don’t do something to adjust the fair market value of the land, the farmers will not
be able to pay it. The farmer is getting penalized for something that he has no control
of and that is why so many counties and towns have gone to land use. A farmer cannot
afford to pay on the fair market value of his land because his equipment, insurance and
everything he needs to operate his farm just eats him up. There is no tax on farm
equipment.
Ms. Ferguson asked about the excessive amount of paper work involved in determining
a person's eligibility for land use. Will the Commissioner’s present staff be able to
handle this increased work or will it require an additional positions. By the time this
program is implemented the Compensation Board will probably fund another person.
Mr. Mays feels confident that the land use system will work. The burden of taxes should
not fall on the property owner.
At 7:35 p.m. Mr. Craft made a motion, seconded by Mr. Conrad, to adjourn. VOTE: Mr.
Conrad, aye; Mr. Craft, aye; Mr. Moore, aye; and Mr. Carter, aye. (4 aye votes — 1
absent)
