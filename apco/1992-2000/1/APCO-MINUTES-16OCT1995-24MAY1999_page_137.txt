Mr. Paulette then asked Mr. Caldwell, Clerk to the Planning Commission
to read the petition.
Mr. Caldwell read petition 96-296 of Darrell W. Litchford for a
Variance to paragraph 170-81 Appomattox County Zoning Ordinance
pertaining to location of Accessory Building. Property is Tax Map
Parcel 34 (1) 14 and is located off Route 611 between Route 670 and
Route 721. Property is zoned A-1.
Mr. Paulette called for comments on this petition.
Mr. Darrell W. Litchford came forward and gave his address as 687
Chestnut Mountain Drive, Lynchburg, VA. Mr. Litchford continued by
saying due to the geography of his lot there was really no way to place
this garage in the rear yard of his property. Mr. Litchford asked that
his request be approved.
Mr. Paulette called for other comments.
Hearing none, Mr. Paulette declared the public hearing closed.
