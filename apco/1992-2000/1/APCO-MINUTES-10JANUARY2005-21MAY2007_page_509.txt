citizens are directly affected in some way, you make every effort to participate in
funding. Rather than do this at budget time, when there are so many requests, she
asked Ms. Knight to wait until things were a bit calmer. The main purpose for her being
here tonight is to say “please don’t forget me in another budget cycle”.
Mr. Craft asked if we had any monies available at this time.
Mr. Carter asked a couple of questions: What is your relationship to Social Services in
this regard? Ms. Knight replied: “Most often when people go to Social Services many
times they don’t have the proper identification or don’t have the proper documentation,
and they don’t bother returning.” Take the case of an elderly lady going to apply for
Social Security benefits and Medicare, was told she could not receive them because she
did not have a Social Security number. She was not able to get a Social Security
number because she did not have a birth certificate. Virginia Legal Aid Society, through
obtaining school records, helped her apply for a delayed birth certificate and was then
able to apply and receive the benefits to which she was entitled.
After a brief question and answer session, Mr. Armbrust made a motion, seconded by
Mr. Craft, to make a donation of $2,000.00 to the Virginia Legal Aid Society. ROLL CALL
VOTE: Mr. Armbrust, aye; Mr. Craft, aye; Mr. Moore, aye; and Mr. Carter, aye. (5 aye
