Mr. Paulette called the hearing to order and stated the purpose of the
hearing was to receive comments on a request to rezone a parcel of
property. Mr. Paulette continued by stating the procedure for
addressing the Board.
Mr. Paulette asked Bill Caldwell, Clerk to the Planning Commission to
read the first petition.
Mr. Caldwell read petition number 96-303 of Watkins M. Abbitt, Jr. to
rezone property from A-1 to R-2. Property is Tax Map Parcel 40-(A)-43
and is located on Route 608 between Route 657 and Route 616.
Mr. Paulette called for comments on this petition.
Mr. Watkins Abbitt came forward and stated his reason for requesting
the rezoning of this property was in order to have less road frontage
per lot. Mr. Abbitt continued that he hopes to sell these lots to
people for modular houses because the housing in the areas was
basically mobile homes or modular houses.
Mr. Paulette called for other comments on this request.
