22. Robert E. Lee Soil & Water Conservation District: Please find enclosed for
your information a copy of the minutes of the Board of Directors meeting held on
April 27, 2006.
Mr. Carter next called for Supervisor Concerns:
Mr. Conrad has received some calls regarding the speed limit on Pumping Station Road
from people who think the speed limit should be lowered to 45 mph. He feels that with
the amount of construction that is taking place in this area, we should contact VDOT
and have them do a traffic study to determine if this lowered speed limit is warranted.
The area in question is at the end of the 35 mph speed zone.
