Ms. Deborah Powell, a member of the Appomattox Anglican Church, stated she is in
support of this petition. Their plans did materialize rather quickly and they look forward
to using this property for a school. They are very glad to have the building and the 6
acres and want to be good neighbors to all the residents in the area.
Mr. Spencer asked if anyone else wished to speak for or against this petition.
Hearing no further questions or comments, Mr. Spencer turned the hearing back to Mr.
Carter.
At 7:33 p.m. Mr. Carter closed the public hearing.
