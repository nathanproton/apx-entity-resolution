AWAG is always doing fund raising activities.
They need building or space for office and storage. They are requesting a $3,000.00
donation from the County for the FY2007 budget.
Mr. Carter thanked Ms. Liska and Ms. Miller for their informative presentation.
Ms. Ferguson stated that all of the adjustments have been made to the budget. Raising
Personal Property from $3.50 per $100 value to $4.50 per $100 value, Machinery and
Tools Tax , we still ended up being $470,324.00 short. She checked with Ms. Belter to
see if we could take one half million dollars from surplus. Ms. Belter felt confident that
this could be done and she would provide these figures on Thursday.
Ms. Ferguson stated she had planned to take $300,000.00 out of the E-911 fund to help
with the budget. After talking with Mr. Wingfield, they decided to take $500,000.00.
This will cover his budget. Next year we won't have the re-assessment and the
additional monies going out for access road. We will be preparing the landfill to go into
the new cell and we can cut that money in half. She is talking about ¥2 million dollars
on the landfill gases project and the money for the CVCC project — just the initial four
(4) rooms. In order to get the budget public hearing advertised, these adjustments
need to be done tonight. If we adopt this budget without the State figures coming in, it
will be with the understanding that if the State figures are different, especially with the
School, we may have to do some amending on the budget. Hopefully, the State budget
will be approved before then.
There was some discussion about increasing the Personal Property to $4.60 as opposed
to raising the Real Estate Tax. Personal Property will affect most everyone not just the
property owners.
The Board by consensus unanimously agreed to set the Personal Property at $4.60 per
$100 value. Merchants Tax at $1.00 per $100 value and Real Estate at $0.72 per $100
value.
Also, increase AWAG to $750.00.
At 7:37 p.m. Mr. Conrad made a motion, seconded by Mr. Armbrust, to adjourn. VOTE:
Mr. Armbrust, aye; Mr. Conrad, aye; Mr. Craft, aye; Mr. Moore, aye; and Mr. Carter, aye.
