At 6:30 p.m. Mr. Carter called the meeting to order and Mr. Spiggle called the Town
Council to order.
Mr. Spiggle stated that from the standpoint of Town Council, having heard all of the
information available, the question is “Where do we go from here?” Mr. Spiggle
explained that Mr. Christie and Mr. Rogers were present to answer any questions that
may arise. This is not a public hearing, but a meeting to receive comments from
everyone. Also, he would ask that everyone limit their remarks to three to five minutes
per person if this is agreeable with everyone present.
Mr. Carter commented that this has been on the table for a number of months and
finally things have started working in a positive manner. Mr. Carter is more in favor of
Alternative 2B.
Mr. Conrad stated that he has, over the years, watched this County grow. In looking
around the state anywhere, the one thing you see, is where a county has public water
it enhances everything. When businesses consider locating in a county, one of the first
things they ask, is “Do you have a public water supply?” If not, they seem to lose
interest quickly. In looking at the alternatives, he feels Alternative 2B as being best
suited for our needs along with the development of a Public Service Authority.
