Mr. Roger Hunt, 135 Country Estates Road, Appomattox, VA. Mr. Hunt stated he
had one question. They are talking about 100 houses on this property, where are they
going to come up with the water? Will this hill support another 100 wells?
Ms. Jacquelina Hunt, 135 Country Estate Road, Appomattox, VA. Ms. Hunt
explained her major concern is that from the plans she has seen some of the traffic will
be coming out through the end of County Estates Road. Part of Country Estates Roadhas a blind curve and when the sun is shinning in your eyes, you cannot see anything.
She cannot see any development being done, until the curve is removed.
