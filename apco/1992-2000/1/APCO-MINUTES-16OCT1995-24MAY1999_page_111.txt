We have read in the Appomattox Times-Virginia, Wednesday, May 1, 1996
issue under Legals, 96291, the request by Mr. Charles Richard Griffin
to be issued a conditional use permit for home occupation (Sporting
Goods Sales) within main dwelling. We are absolutely opposed to any
reductions in our restrictions. Our decision to move into our present
house was based on the protection that we have in the current zoning
code and the neighborhood restrictions.
We enjoy the peace and quite of this neighborhood and know that a
business located just down the street will upset that tranquility. Our
retirement has been wonderful because we took the time to locate a spot
that would create a peaceful atmosphere. Please don’t upset that now
by granting Mr. Griffin’s request.
Sincerely,
Marion & Frances V. Preble.

Attn: Mr. Philip Paulette
We are writing in reference to the Zoning Petition Number 96-291. As
residents of the Cedar Knolls Subdivision, we are very concerned, not
only with the added traffic, but the noise, and the impending threat to
our safety.
We moved into this neighborhood a few years ago in order to enjoy the
peace and quietness that this area affords. Recently, there have been
times of rapid gun fire, which sounded as if target practice is being
held right in our yards. If this permit is granted to Mr. Charles E.
Griffin for Conditional Use for Sporting Goods Sales, our safety as
well as the safety of the children and visitors to this area will be
jeopardized.
We feel that this type of business should be conducted in the areas set
aside for such, and not in our neighborhoods. Therefore any
consideration that you can give in reference to our concerns will be
very much appreciated.
Thanking you in advance,
Leroy and Abbie Logan
