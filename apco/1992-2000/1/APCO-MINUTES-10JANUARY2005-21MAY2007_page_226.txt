Water Project: David Garrett and Ms. Ferguson met with the CCUSA to begin
negotiations on water rates. In order to get this figure some additional
engineering work will need to be done. CCUSA is paying half of the cost for this
work and is requesting the other half to be paid by Appomattox County and the
Town of Appomattox. The cost to each of the localities is $3,750.00. These
funds are already available in the budget; therefore no additional funds are being
requested.
