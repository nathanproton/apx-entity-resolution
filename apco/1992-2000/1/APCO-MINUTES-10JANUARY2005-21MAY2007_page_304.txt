Mr. Conrad stated that we do not own the Town Office building. The Board should have
its own space for meetings, etc. We need to thank the Town for the use of Council
Chambers and move forward to finding another location to house the Board of
Supervisors. Until such time as we locate a suitable meeting location, he suggests that
we use the Appomattox Community Center on a temporary basis.
The Board by consensus, approved for Ms. Ferguson to notify David Garrett, Town
Manager, of the Board's decision.
9. Planning Commission Action from the January 17, 2006 Public Hearing:
PETITION 05-556 — Travis Ford: The applicant is requesting a Conditional Use
Permit to allow a vehicle graveyard on Route 460 between Route 609 and Route
667. The subject property, identified as Tax Map Number 60(4)B, is 5.05 acres
in size and is zoned Industrial District M-1. The applicant’s business, Ragnarok,
Inc., was the beneficiary of a Conditional Use Permit granted to Hackett
Enterprises on August 1, 2005 which allowed the operation of a concrete
contractor’s facility on this same parcel. Approval of this current request would
result in vehicle graveyard becoming a Conditional Use in the Industrial District
M-1 and would thus amend the County Zoning Ordinance (Section 170-25).
The Planning Commission tabled the discussion on the above petition. Additional
research is required by the County Attorney.
