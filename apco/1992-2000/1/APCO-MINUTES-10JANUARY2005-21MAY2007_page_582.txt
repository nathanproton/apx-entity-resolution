There were some questions regarding the acreage and income from farming to qualify
for this land use taxation break. And what is the cycle for change in the value of the
property?
Mr. Overstreet stated that he is only familiar with the Bedford County Ordinance, as he
lives in Bedford County. That ordinance was developed in a manner that the Board
adopts the Land Use Ordinance and then it is up to the Commissioner of Revenue to
determine whether it fits into bona fide agricultural land and what that evaluation is.
According to what he has seen here, and looked at in the Code, it seems to him that the
guidance that the Commissioner is given in one section says “prior to assessment of any
parcel under this Ordinance, the local assessing officer shall determine if the real estate
is devoted solely to agriculture, horticulture use and consists of a minimum of 5 acres”.
This is set forth in the Code, so he does not know how much discretion there is in what
Mr. Mays has said because if other localities had more flexibility with that, he would like
to talk to them to see how they got around this issue, it seems to him that the Board is
somewhat restricted to just adopting the ordinance and then Mr. Mays or his
predecessor , would do the assessing of the value, using his personal knowledge and
what has taken place in the County and recommendations of the State Land Evaluation
Advisory Council, which is located at Virginia Tech. Based on the Code, there is nothing
in the ordinance that states five (5) acres, it is what the Commissioner of Revenue does.
Applications for this tax break have to be submitted each year. In some cases, the
application fee will be more than the taxes themselves.
Mr. Mays closed by saying that if the Board needs additional information or needed to
have another work session, let him know, as he is about to enter into his busy season.
But, we really need to get this done.
