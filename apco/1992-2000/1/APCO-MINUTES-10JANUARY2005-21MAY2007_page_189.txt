13. Application of Virginia Electric & Power Company: Dominion Virginia
Power has filed an application to revise its market prices for generation and
resulting wires charges for calendar year 2006.
14, Department of Transportation: Quarterly report from the Virginia
Department of Transportation.
Mr. Carter next called for Supervisor Concerns:
Mr. Conrad said he had gotten a few calls regarding the Oakville School being an eye
sore and wanted to know if some of the items there could possibly be put up for
auction.
Ms. Ferguson stated that due to manpower, it would not be possible to move these
items from Oakville to the School Auction held each year. It would probably be best to
hold an auction on premises. She is currently working on this project.
Mr. Armbrust had some questions regarding the incorrect information circulating on the
PSA and the waterline. He feels we need to educate the citizens on what a PSA does
and how they will regulate without bias. Also rumor has it that everyone will have to
“hook up”. Citizens need to know that the only people paying for this will be the users.
Mr. Armbrust also informed those present that he does indeed return calls to persons in
his district who call him regarding a problem.
Mr. Carter asked if there was documentation passed out at the meeting last week at the
Community Center as to the definition of a PSA. He feels we need some positive “public
relations” and asked for suggestions on how to enhance the knowledge of this to the
general public.
