3. Effective Rate Increase: The County of Appomattox proposes to
adopt a tax rate of $0.55 per $100 of assessed value. The difference
between the lowered tax rate and the proposed tax rate would be $.06
per $100, or 13 percent. This difference will be known as the
"effective tax rate increase".
Individual property taxes may, however, increase at a percentage
greater than or less than the above percentages.
4. Proposed Total Budget Increase: Based on the proposed real
property tax rate and changes in other revenues, the total budget of
Appomattox County will exceed last year’s by 3 percent.
A Public Hearing on the increase will be held on March 11, 1996 at 7:00
P.M. at the Appomattox County Courthouse, Court Street, Appomattox, VA.
Being no further business, Mr. Bosiger made a motion seconded by Mr.
