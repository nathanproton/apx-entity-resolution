Mr. Overstreet stated that he had one statement regarding the Family Sub-Division and
the Planning Commission has already considered this and made a decision on how to
address it. He feels the Board should know what authority you have to do, you may
choose to agree with the Planning Commission, but he felt it was his duty to let the
Board know that they have a little broader authority. When the new section of the Code
came in regarding how long an individual has to hold property under a family
conveyance and the reason for this is that an individual may buy acreage, divided up
into one acre lots, saying it is family sub-division in order to circumvent the ordinance.
Right now, we say, the way this is developed, a person would have to hold the property
for five (5) years before reselling it. The Code of Virginia allows your Ordinance to say
that the head of the family who owned the property, had to have it for fifteen (15) years
and the family member to whom it was conveyed has to hold it for fifteen (15) years.
You have this broader authority and the Planning Commission felt that five (5) years
was sufficient, but you do have the authority to go further with this.
At 6:20 p.m. Mr. Carter closed the public hearing.
