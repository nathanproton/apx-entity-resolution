In the State of Virginia, 89 localities presently have land use. Buckingham will be going
to land use shortly. Mr. Mays is proposing that wooded land be assessed at $600.00 per
acre and open land at $600.00 to $700.00. The income requirement is $1,000.00.
We would need to adopt a land use ordinance six (6) months prior to re-assessment (7-
01-07).
After a brief discussion period, Mr. Carter thanked Mr. Mays for his very informative
presentation.
At 7:00 p.m. Mr. Carter called for a short recess.
At 7:12 p.m. Mr. Carter reconvened the meeting.
Mr. Carter presented other items for discussion.
1. Proposed Capital Projects: At the last meeting, each board member was
provided with financial information concerning proposed capital projects that we
need to discuss.
A. County Administration Building $150,000
B. CVCC Satellite Renovation/Repair 350,000
on Gas Remediation System 465,000
D. Gas Remediation System Engineering 150,000
Subtotal $1,115,000
E. CVCC Phase 2 418,000
Total Immediate Needs $1,533,000
Ms. Ferguson discussed briefly the most pressing of these projects.
Mr. Spencer discussed the renovation/repairs to the Old Elementary School for CVCC
Satellite as well as the Phase 2 project. At present there will be seven (7) classrooms,
and the rest of the area being administrative. There are two (2) computer oriented
classrooms, one a more traditional classroom and some administrative usage. Phase 2,
would be entirely classrooms. Mr. Spencer stated that the building is really shaping up
nicely and if anyone is interested in taking a look, he would be more than glad to take
them over.
Mr. Conrad stated he felt we needed to proceed with the improvements necessary for
the operation of the county’s business.
The Board by consensus agreed to move ahead with all phases of A, B, C, D, & E above.
2. Press Release: Ms. Ferguson provided each one with a copy of the press
release that will run in this week’s Times-Virginian concerning Campbell County
Revenue Recovery for emergency medical transports.
Also, the Sheriff is requesting additional staffing until the 911 Call Center if up
and running.
