Use is not currently allowed in the B-1 Zoning District. Currently, this use is
permitted as a use by right in the R-1, R-2 and PUD districts. It is a Conditional
Use in the A-1 and V-1 districts.
PROPOSED AMENDMENT:
Add the use category “Schools” to the list of conditional uses within the B-1 zoning district.
Mr. Carter asked if anyone had comments:
Mr. Jeffrey Hubler, Cornerstone Christian Academy: He is one of the organizers
of the Cornerstone Christian Academy and they already have fifty (50) children applying
for attendance to this school. They have a particular piece of property in mind for this
school. He is in favor of changing the Zoning Ordinance, Section B-1 Commercial
District, section 170-47 Conditional Use.
Ms. Marcie Jones, Principal of the Cornerstone Christian Academy: Ms. Jones
is in favor of Conditional Use change in a B-1 area. Schools do function well in a
business area. Not too many people want schools in a residential area. They see a
number of children going outside of the County to attend private schools. There are a
large group of Home Schooled children in the County.
At 6:22 p.m. Mr. Marvin Mitchell arrived.
At 6:23 p.m. Mr. Carter closed the Public Hearing.
