your name and address for the record.
Ms. Terri Conrad, 102 Acorn Drive, Appomattox, VA: Ms. Conrad stated that
when she spoke to the Board previously, that she was speaking of using part of the
Carver-Price Education Building but they are so appreciative to the Board for coming up
with this wonderful idea for them because it not only incorporates a space for us but
incorporates part of their mission and that is to help keep intact historical buildings. She
would really like to say a heartfelt “Thank You”.
