At 6:00 p.m. Mr. Carter called the meeting to order, welcomed everyone present
and asked Mr. Moore to give the invocation.
Mr. Mays handed out information pertaining to the value of land presently on the books.
He also stated he had been chosen as the spokesperson for the Farmer Bureau and the
farmers in the county. On behalf of these, he appreciates the time and opportunity to
go over some figures that should take the guessing game out of where we stand. From
1978 to 1984 land values increased by 69%; 1984 to 1990 by 20%; 1990 to 1996
by39%; 1996 to 2006 by 27% and the projected figures from 2002 to 2008 will increase
by 216%. Land value on the books at the present time is $224,560,700. This is land
only, no buildings, etc. Land only.
Mr. Mays explained the various land categories such as Commercial, Building Sites,
Swamp, Wooded, Cutover, etc.- Values Now and the Projected Value. Most of these
projected values are on the conservative side. This does not include State or National
Forest/Park land. His projections are that land values with double.
Mr. Mays next discussed the % of tax decreases after Re-assessment. In 1977-1978 the
decrease was 34%; 1983-1984 - 8%; 1989-1990 — 0%; 1995-1996 — 35% and 2001-
2002 — 22%.
Mr. Mays does not have any idea of the impact of land use. He has no way of knowing
how many farmers will qualify or how many will be interested in taking advantage of this
taxation method. Using the worse case scenario the tax rate would be .52 cents per
100 without land use and about .56 cents with land use. For the first year of land use,
the cost will be $12.00 per farmer, plus .12 per acre in application fees. This money will
go directly to the Treasurer. Farmers must re-apply in six (6) years. Applications must
be received by November 2007. Mr. Mays thinks this process may result in the creation
of one (1) employee. He will take care of this the first year but after that, it will be
some one else’s call.
