Mr. Waddell discussed a chart prepared by Mr. Perrow comparing 2006-07 teacher’s
salaries by experience to the surrounding counties. Overall, Appomattox was below the
other counties with the exception of starting salaries, which ranked second. Teachers
are a lot more transient today, than they were several years ago, especially if they can
make several thousand dollars more in an adjoining county.

rate.
Reply that the strategic Reading program for ninth graders as well as several other
options - GED program. There is also a year long English class and several other special

not to return.
