6. Planning Commission Action from the October 17, 2005 Public Hearing:
Petition #05-557 of Gary Warner, and others to rezoning of an A-1 tract
Stonewall has been withdrawn by the owners.
There was no action taken on this item.
Mr. Armbrust questioned a couple of other projects that Mr. Warner was involved in.
One on the Moses tract and the other the Retirement Village off Route 26.
Mr. Overstreet stated that he and Mr. Spencer would look into what is happening on
these projects. Mr. Spencer stated that he has seen no site plans for the Freedom Ridge
project other than what was presented initially.
7. Ordinance Changes or Adoption: Mr. Overstreet has provided draft
ordinances concerning partial assessment of new construction and PPTRA. Mr.
Mays and Ms. Belter have also been provided a copy of these ordinances for their
comments. No comments have been received as of today.
Ms. Belter has informed Ms. Ferguson that there is already guidance in place concerning
any assessment made under this section after September 1 of any year, the penalty for
non-payment by December 5 shall be extended to February 5 of the succeeding year.
Ms. Belter gave a brief review of how the Personal Property Tax Relief Act of 1998. In
1998 the taxpayers received a refund check from the State on personal property. From
1999 to current, personal property was supposed to be phased out completely. In 2001
we had reached the 70% reimbursement rate. 2005 will be the last year you will see
this 70%. Starting in 2006 the State will cap the amount, based on our 2004 collection
from personal property. The taxpayer will not see the 70% on their tax bill. We do not
know what this rate will be, we will know more after March 2006 when we get the
figures from Richmond.
Mr. Overstreet explained how he interpreted this new tax ordinance.
A Public Hearing was scheduled for December 12, 2005 at 6:30 p.m. on the Personal
Property Tax Relief Act and partial assessment. Place of meeting will be announced
later.
