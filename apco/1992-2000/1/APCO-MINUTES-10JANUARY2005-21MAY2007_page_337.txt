Mr. Perrow briefly discussed the $175,000 placed in the budget for maintenance.
Because so much emphasis has been placed on No Child Left Behind and the SOL’s
some maintenance and repairs have not been done in the past several years.
Division Wide Needs:
e Long Term maintenance projects
Ongoing preventive maintenance
Protection of multi-million dollar investment
Fields and play area at all schools
Meet ADA requirements
Compliance with fire Code —- NFPA 72 - Insurance company’s request
Year 2000 Facility Needs (separate handout)
eeeeee
Mr. Perrow stated that some maintenance projects were done during the summer. This
makes it harder to deal with financially as it involves budget year crossover. A separate
CIP account for the school system would help.
