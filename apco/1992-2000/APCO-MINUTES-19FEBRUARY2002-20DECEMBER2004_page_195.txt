and Members of the Virginia General Assembly to reinstate the Personal Property Tax
on automobiles until the economy of Virginia is restored to health.
VOTE: Mr. Carwile, aye; Mr. Moore, aye; Mr. Kendrick, aye; and Mr. Carter, aye.
7. Hunting Regulations: At the last meeting, a question was raised concerning
hunters shooting from the road. Page 24 of the “Hunting and Trapping in
Virginia” handbook clearly states that it is illegal to shoot from the road. This
handbook also states that localities have the ability to impose greater road hunting
restrictions through the use of setbacks from the road.
Mr. Kendrick stated that he thought the question was not “shooting from the road” but the
carrying of loaded guns on the highway.
Mr. Carroll stated that on page 28, Items 15 - 21, of the handbook deals with the various
laws controlling weapons on the roadway that could be enacted by a locality.
Mr. Kendrick would like to find out more regarding these regulations and discuss again at
the January 21* meeting.
Mr. Kendrick made a motion seconded by Mr. Carwile to table this discussion until the
January 21, 2003 meeting. VOTE: Mr. Carwile, aye; Mr. Moore, aye; Mr. Kendrick,
aye; and Mr. Carter, aye.
