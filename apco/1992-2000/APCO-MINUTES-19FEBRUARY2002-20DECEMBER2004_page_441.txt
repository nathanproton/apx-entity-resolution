Mr. Carter stated that last year funds were cut from the Electoral Board’s Budget and
asked Mr. Joe Foxwell of the Electoral Board to give an explanation.
Mr. Foxwell stated that last year all the departments had to relinquish funds because of
fund shortages statewide. Since they are a small department they do not have any “fat” in
their budget. However, one item cut was the wages for the Electoral Workers. With the
elections this past November, the upcoming presidential primary and town elections,
additional funds will be needed to pay electoral workers.
