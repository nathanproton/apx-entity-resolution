9A. Amendment to Chapter 133 County Code: When the Road Naming was
done, in conjunction with E-911, it only bought us to a certain point, it did not
really prepare us for actually implementing E-911 and to continue to preserve
the data base, etc. The new E-911 Coordinator is proposing an amendment to
the existing ordinance that will cover ongoing maintenance issues, procedural
issues, etc. Also, changes were made in the original ordinance changing “The
County Administrator” to “E-911 Coordinator”. Article II, Section 133.4 is the
new amendment to the ordinance, addressing the things we will be facing in the
future. We need to set a Public Hearing Date for this Amendment in order to get
this ordinance in place.
