Mrs. Ferguson stated she had expected to have a change order regarding a brick
wall to cover the meter base on the entrance side of the courthouse. This meter
base would have been covered by the connector wall between the two buildings.
However, when the connecting wall was disallowed, something else had to be
done.
Mr. Carter stated the Board needed to set the Tax Rate for 2005. The proposed

dollars of assessed value

Mrs. Ferguson called the Board’s attention to the revised School Budget on the
revenue side, Revenue Funds. There is a local program support of $489,000. In
the previous report, not knowing what the State Revenue was going to be, that
amount was $1,666,000. Dr. Krug has written a letter of explanation, very
detailed as to where those funds are going and what they are used for. This
amount has been reduced considerably.
At 7:15 p.m. Mr. Conrad made a motion, seconded by Mr. Armbrust, to adjourn.
VOTE: Mr. Armburst, aye; Mr. Conrad, aye; Mr. Craft, aye; Mr. Moore, aye; and
Mr. Carter, aye. (5 aye votes)
