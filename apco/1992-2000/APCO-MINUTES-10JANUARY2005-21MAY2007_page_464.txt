7. Appropriation Resolution for Fiscal Year 2007: The Appropriation
Resolution for FY 2007 needs to be adopted.
Ms. Ferguson stated that generally the Appropriations Resolution is adopted at the same
time as the budget. However, this year the budget was adopted contingent on State
funding, awaiting the approval of the State Budget. After reviewing the State funding, it
appears everything is in order. Now we need to approve the Appropriation Resolution to
complete the budget process.
Mr. Craft made a motion, seconded by Mr. Conrad, to adopt the following Appropriations
Resolution for the Fiscal Year 2007:
