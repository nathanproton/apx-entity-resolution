Request for subdivision plat waiver: Mary K. Hubbard has applied for a waiver of the
minimum road frontage requirements of §141-25(B)(2) of the Appomattox County
Subdivision Ordinance, which must be granted by the Board of Supervisors (see attached
documentation). The Planning Commission reviewed her situation on August 20th as a
request for interpretation from the zoning administrator, and moved unanimously to
recommend that the subdivision plot waiver be granted for the following reasons:
1. The existing platted lots are insufficient to meet the minimum road frontage
requirements when combined.
2. Additional land has been obtained but not enough to increase the road frontage to
100 feet.
3. No property can be acquired from adjacent owners in order to increase the road
frontage to 100 feet.
Mr. Carter made a motion seconded by Mr. Moore to approve request of Mary K. Hubbard for a
subdivision plat waiver per §141-25(B)(2) of the Appomattox County Subdivision Ordinance
pertaining to minimum required road frontage of 100 feet per lot. VOTE: Mr. Kendrick, aye; Mr.
Carter, aye; Mr. Hancock, aye; Mr. Carwile, aye; and Mr. Moore, aye.
