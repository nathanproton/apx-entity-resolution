Mr. Carter then called for Supervisor Concerns:
Mr. Conrad: Upon entering into the new budget process, we in the past have let the
School Board and the Constitutional Officers know we try to fund them as much as 2/3
- 3/4 of the proposed budget. He would like to look at maybe next year, based on
research to think about determining how much we can afford, if possible, to give the
schools based on the revenue we expect. Then present this figure to the School Board
and ask that they work their budget within this figure. They will then have to prioritize
their needs.
Mr. Armbrust: No concerns. He would like to note that it was very honorable of the
American Legion to make the comments regarding the recent mix up.
Mr. Craft: He would like to report that Halifax voted to allow Appomattox into the
Regional Jail Authority by a 7 — 0 vote at their meeting on 2-5-07.
