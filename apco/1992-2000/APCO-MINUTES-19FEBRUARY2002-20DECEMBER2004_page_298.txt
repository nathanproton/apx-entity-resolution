Mr. Kendrick made a motion seconded by Mr. Moore to approve the
recommended criteria and use of E-911 tax funds for the E-911 Structure Number
Signage as a part of the E911 implementation project. VOTE: Mr. Hancock, aye; —
Mr. Carwile, aye; Mr. Moore, aye; Mr. Kendrick, aye; and Mr. Carter, aye. (5 aye
votes)
Mr. Carter next called for consideration of the Consent Agenda: (items 6-13)
Mr. Carroll stated there were two (2) changes to the Consent Agenda.
Item 8 — Ball Park: There were two bills submitted for the work
performed at the Ball Park. One for the transportation and one for the soil.
Since we have already paid the soil bill, they will waive the transportation
cost. Therefore, this item can be removed from the Consent Agenda.
Also Stonewall Vineyards normally has several “Summer Cooler
Festivals” and they failed to get their permit request in for the first one to
be held on June 14" from 5:30 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. Since there will not be a
Board meeting between now and the date of this event, Mr. Carroll asked
that the Board add this to the Consent Agenda contingent upon their
paying the festival permit fee.
6. Approval of Bills: Please approve bills as presented.
7. Approval of Minutes: Please approve minutes of Regular meeting of 4-
21-03; Budget Workshop of 4-28-03; and Regular meeting of 5-5-03. od
