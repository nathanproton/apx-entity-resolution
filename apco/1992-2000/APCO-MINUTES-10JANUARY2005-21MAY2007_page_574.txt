10. Supervisor Concerns:
Mr. Conrad has a concern regarding transportation. An article in the newspaper recently
indicated the State Legislature is considering action on a proposal that when zoning is
approved for the development of new subdivisions that the new roads in these
subdivisions be funded at the expense of local governments.
Ms. Ferguson will check on this and see about developing a resolution opposing this
matter.
Mr. Armbrust wanted to thank everyone for their cooperation and hard work. In looking
back at some of the things we have accomplished that this will be an exciting year
because now we can concentrate on other things. He would also like to thank the staff
and others that are constantly working behind the scenes.
Mr. Moore would like to see something done with the Oakville School building. This
building is about to fall down, the windows are all out and it is an eyesore to the
community. If nothing else, have the Fire Department do a controlled burn.
