10. Supervisor Concerns:
Mr. Armbrust: The request from the American Legion, Post 104, for a refund of
$3,000.00 that was discussed at the last meeting. There were a couple of “quotes”
published in newspaper that he would like to set straight. They were asking for the
$3,000.00 to be refunded and this request was denied because it was presented to us
as a discretionary fund to be used for further maintenance and upkeep of the Wall of
Honor. This idea was presented by the American Legion. Mr. Armbrust is requesting
that the American Legion representatives come to the February 6, 2007 meeting and
present their financial statement regarding monies received and expended. It was his
understanding that the names, benches, bricks, etc., were to be paid for by individuals
or business donations.
Ms. Ferguson remarked that when she responded to the American Legion telling them
the decision of the Board to deny the refund of this $3,000.00, she sent them a copy of
the agreement along with the letter and explained to them as the Board had stated at
the last meeting, if they wish to come before the Board and present more information
than what we already had, to contact her and she would schedule a time. She had not
heard anything officially from them.
Mr. Armbrust stated they are already asking for more space to do more things to make
this project bigger, we need to know what they plan to do, and where they plan to go as
well as their financial statements. This is a very nice memorial to our veterans, etc., and
